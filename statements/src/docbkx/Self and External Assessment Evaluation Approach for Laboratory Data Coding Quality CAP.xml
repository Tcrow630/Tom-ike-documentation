        <title>Self-Assessment Evaluation Approach for Laboratory Data Coding Quality</title>
        <para>Replacing vendor-developed custom codes with existing standard ontology codes and
            incorporating these codes into the LIS and EHR system will require a change in workflow
            as well as maintenance of coding to ensure their continued accuracy. It is to be
            expected that standard coding systems will require periodic updates to provide for the
            orderly release of new codes, revision of existing codes to correct errors and the
            deprecation of out-of-date codes. The current workflow for most labs is to perform
            mapping of local tests to standardized codes infrequently with very rare updating of
            codes. These mapping activities usually coincide with the addition of a new test to the
            laboratory menu, implementation of a new LIS or EHR system or to satisfy the
            requirements of a clinical trial, public health reporting requirement or clinician
            needs.</para>
        <para>The proposed strategy of advancing laboratory interoperability hinges on utilizing a
            set of standardized codes to digitally represent laboratory test results. For each IVD
            platform, the following codes will be enumerated for each test the IVD has FDA approval
            for use:</para>

        <para>This strategy is predicated on the assumption that the healthcare ecosystem
            infrastructure will be able to capture and transmit these standardized data elements and
            that the coding will be accurate and up-to- date. While the first assumption will be
            explored elsewhere in this document, this section touches on the requiredtools that will
            need to be developed to aid laboratory personnel in the upkeep of coding to ensure their
            continued accuracy and quality. These tools will need to minimize the administrative
            burden on laboratory personnel and include:</para>

            <title>Laboratory Interoperability Data Repository (LIDR)</title>
            <para>The Laboratory Interoperability Data Repository is intended to serve as a
                centralized repository of standardized codes that have been curated by IVD vendors
                for their menu of test offerings. LIDR would serve as the authoritative source of
                truth for the digital representation of any IVD test. To serve this intended
                function, LIDR must be easily accessible to laboratory personnel to query for the
                prescriptive list of standardized codes for test order and analytes, specimen source
                and types, result values (nominal and ordinal), and instrument and reagent kit
                information. The codes should be searchable by the combination of test and
                instrument vendor through a human searchable interface. It is envisioned that
                laboratory personnel could access LIDR to query and download the curated codes for
                initial implementation of an assay and also to verify the accuracy of the coding for
                existing tests in their LIS/EHR system. </para>
        </sect2>
        <sect2>
            <title>LIS/EHR Report Templates</title>
            <para>Although standardized codes intended to allow for interoperability of laboratory
                data has been in existence for decades, there remains significant variation in how
                these codes are incorporated into LIS/EHR systems. Although the transmission of
                these codes in HL7 messages are relatively well-defined, the fields into which they
                are entered in LIS/EHR systems can vary significantly depending on which LIS or EHR
                system is utilized. In addition, a given assay offered by a laboratory requires the
                creation of numerous records in the LIS and EHR systems for the test to be
                orderable, billable, and performable. The LOINC code for the test order is likely to
                be contained in the record required for the test to be orderable through
                computerized order entry in the EHR, while the LOINC code for the performable test
                or analyte is usually contained in the test record created in the LIS that allows
                the laboratory to perform and report the results of the test. A test may be composed
                of a number of components, and each of these components may have a separate result
                with its own associated unit of measure or SNOMED-encoded qualitative results.
                Specimen information with SNOMED codes associated with the specimen type may be
                contained in its own record separate from the test record. </para>
            <para>For laboratory personnel to maintain the accuracy of coding in the LIS/EHR systems
                with minimal administrative burden, the standardized codes must be transparent and
                easily accessible to laboratory personnel. Transparency of coding is currently a
                challenge as these codes can be dispersed across a variety of LIS and EHR records as
                illustrated above. In addition, the standardized codes are not usually visible
                outside of these records, which are not accessible to most laboratory personnel. The
                coding and maintenance of these records are managed by information system analysts.
                To obtain these codes, laboratory personnel must request reports generated by the IS
                analysts. This may result in multiple reports that must be collated to present all
                the relevant codes in an understandable manner. LIS/EHR report templates specific to
                the LIS and/or EHR systems utilized by the laboratories would enable laboratories to
                perform self-assessments of their coding to identify errors and deprecated codes
                that need to be replaced. These report templates would be available as part of a
                self-assessment toolkit and would obviate the need for laboratories to formulate
                their own reports to see the coding in their system. </para>
        </sect2>
        <sect2>
            <title>Coding Change Request Templates</title>
            <para>When an error or code replacement is identified, it is essential that the code
                change occurs in an efficient manner to maintain data coding quality. As alluded to
                above, the LIS and EHR records that contain the standardized codes associated with a
                given assay are maintained by IS analysts. These analysts may be embedded within the
                laboratory, or more commonly, are part of the larger IS group that support the
                information technology needs for the entire enterprise or institution. These IS
                analysts may or may not have a laboratory background. Correction or replacement of
                codes requires clear communication between laboratory personnel who likely have no
                expertise with the LIS software and IS analysts who may be unfamiliar with
                laboratory processes. </para>
            <para>To minimize miscommunication that may arise with code change requests, code change
                request templates specific to the LIS or EHR system used by the laboratory could
                constitute part of the self- assessment toolkit provided to laboratories. The change
                request templates would ideally be a smart form that could display information on
                the standardized code that is being requested to be inserted into the LIS and EHR
                system as well as the record and field within the record that the code should be
                inserted. </para>

        <title>External Assessment Evaluation Approach for Laboratory Data Coding Quality</title>
        <para>The custom codes used by proficiency testing (PT) vendors to standardize the
            representation of required laboratory data elements is not incorporated into LIS and EHR
            systems. By replacing these customs codes with standardized codes that are incorporated
            into the LIS and EHR systems and attached to patient results as well as PT results,
            laboratory data interoperability can be advanced for patients and the rest of the
            healthcare ecosystem. Developing an external assessment evaluation requires an
            understanding of what data elements could be evaluated during data transmissions. The
            table below lists the data elements that are available for evaluation.<informaltable>

            </informaltable></para>
        <para>As can be seen in the table, some of the proposed standardized coding elements such as
            LOINC for test order and analyte and SNOMED codes for specimen information and
            qualitative results can already be accommodated for in data transmissions. While there
            are three fields currently associated with instrumentation, utilizing these data
            elements as they are currently configured for interoperability would be problematic.
            First, these fields are generally utilized by laboratories as part of the internal
            laboratory workflow such as tracking quality control performance and are usually not
            transmitted as part of result reports. Secondly, as with local test codes, tests names
            and normal range values, instrument and method naming conventions can vary significantly
            from laboratory to laboratory. For these fields to be useful for the purposes of
            interoperability, there would need to be standardization of how instruments are
            represented across all laboratories as well as transmission of this information with the
            laboratory result. A preferred alternative is to utilize the IVD instrument and test kit
            unique device identifier (UDI), which is maintained by the FDA and standardized.
            However, LIS and EHR functionality to capture and transmit instrument and test kit UDI
            does not currently exist, and will require a change to the healthcare ecosystem
            infrastructure in order to accommodate these data elements. </para>
        <para>For example, when a client laboratory enrolls in transmission of PT results, there is
            an onboarding process that includes mapping of the client’s local test menu to the
            custom codes used by the PT vendor. The appropriate custom codes are provided to the
            laboratory based on the information provided in their PT survey enrollment. A similar
            approach could be taken by providing the standardized codes contained in LIDR that
            matches the client laboratory’s lab menu and instrumentation. To ensure that
            laboratories do not fail their PT survey because of incorrect custom coding of their lab
            menu, there is current functionality that allows for subscriber laboratories to evaluate
            whether the custom code mapping is accurate prior to the submission of any PT survey
            results. This functionality could be modified and expanded to form the basis for an
            external assessment evaluation of standardized coding in a laboratory’s LIS and EHR
            system. The proposed external assessment evaluation components of the coding quality
            assurance program include: <orderedlist>

        <sect2>
            <title>Laboratory Menu Compendium Error Checking</title>
            <para>The first external assessment component of the quality assurance program for coding the laboratory menu compendium error check. This entails uploading the complete test compendium for a client laboratory including any standardized coding for evaluation to a cloud-based server. The cloud-based server would be populated with all the standardized coding available in LIDR. The standardized codes contained in the client laboratory’s compendium would be compared to the expected coding contained in LIDR for the laboratory’s testing and instrumentation. This is expected to occur at initial onboarding of a client laboratory and every six months.
                
                The purpose of the periodic evaluation is to identify any deprecated codes that need to be replaced as well as any inaccurate mapping that might have occurred in the interim periods. By automating these periodic checks, laboratories will hopefully be able to minimize the work associated with keeping up to date with new code releases. Any errors detected in the compendium check would ideally be corrected in the cloud-based hub interface. At the very least, the interface should allow for the generation of change request forms that can be utilized to communicate with the LIS analysts who would need to make the correction.

        <sect2>
            <title>Instance Error Checking</title>
            <para>Instance error checking allows the client laboratory to test their standardized
                coding configuration against the expected LIDR coding curated by the IVD vendors.
                The test submission would be a simulation of a PT survey submission with all the
                associated standardized coding and metadata. Coding for the submission would be
                derived from the same LIS and EHR configuration utilized for patient results. This
                would have the benefit of not only ensuring coding is accurate prior to PT survey
                result submission but would also ensure that the coding associated with patient
                results is also complete and accurate. </para>
            <para>Feedback on the success or failure status for each challenge in the submission
                could be sent back to a work queue in the client laboratory’s LIS or alternatively
                could be sent as an email with details on the status and any errors detected that
                need to be resolved. It is envisioned that the instance check would be utilized
                prior to a PT survey submission to confirm accuracy of coding prior to submitting
                graded PT survey responses but could also be utilized to confirm the correct coding
                for a new assay implemented by the laboratory. </para>
