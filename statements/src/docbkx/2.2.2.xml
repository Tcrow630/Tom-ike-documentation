    <title>The Need for Integrated Knowledge Management</title>

        <title>The Promise of Health Information Technology</title>
        <para>Health Information Technology (IT), or the use of computer hardware, software, or
            infrastructure to record, store, protect, and retrieve clinical, administrative, or
            financial information, has become a critically important form of organizing, managing,
            analyzing, and exchanging patient health information. [1] Though first employed in the
            1960s, Health IT entered the scene and obtained widespread adoption in the early-1990s
            promising: </para>
        <para>1. The enhancement of quality and safety of healthcare, </para>
        <para>2. The ability to more easily measure and reduce the cost of care, </para>
        <para>3. The ability to share information with multiple providers across organizations in a
            continuum of care, </para>
        <para>4. The ability to implement and automate high-quality decision support into clinical
            workflows, and </para>
        <para>5. The ability to improve clinician/provider satisfaction and reduce burden and
            burnout. [2] </para>
        <para>The most commonly known forms of Health IT systems, Electronic Health Records (EHRs),
            or a systematized collection of electronically stored patient and population health
            information, have undoubtably enabled dramatic advancements in patient care, allowing
            for breakthrough technologies with advanced analytical capabilities (e.g., Machine
            Learning [ML], Artificial Intelligence [AI]) to more easily identify new diseases and
            develop treatments and reduce the need for patients to maintain and carry paper records
            from provider to provider. </para>
        <para>Despite advancement in technologies like these, a Johns Hopkins study conducted in
            2016 suggested that preventable medical errors, including those due to EHR errors,
            accounted for approximately 250,000 patient deaths every year – making it the
            third-leading cause of death in the United States. [3] When Crico, a medical
            professional liability organization, identified 147 cases of patient harm over five
            years in which an EHR was identified as a contributing factor, a staggering 80 percent
            of these cases involved moderate or severe harm to the patient. [4] In total, an
            estimated $61 million in direct payments and legal expenses resulted from these cases,
            at an average cost of $415,000 per case. </para>
        <para>On the surface, exciting new technology has continued to advance in the healthcare
            ecosystem, but cases of patient harm, redundant testing, and over-expenditure persists.
            This begs the question: is Health IT truly fulfilling its promises? </para>
        <para>Technology has the potential to revolutionize patient care – concepts like AI and ML
            promise better patient outcomes and reduced clinician burden. However, these systems are
            only as good as the data from which they operate. EHRs, for example, were created to
            provide healthcare automation, patient care and patient access, and reduce clinician
            workload. The advancements in EHRs have had a great impact for patients, but users
            continue to face complications due to the lack of standardized data exchange.
            Unstandardized data stacking has made it difficult to interpret a patient’s chart with
            accurate data reporting. [5] As far as healthcare technology has come, the quality of
            existing technology platforms is limited through the quality of encoded data – which is
            where the problem begins. </para>

        <title>The Problems with Electronic Health Data</title>
        <para>While healthcare information originates across a variety of disparate systems and
            organizations, the United States healthcare environment requires interoperable,
            coordinated, and accurate information to support high quality patient care, clinical and
            laboratory research, public health monitoring, and regulatory decision making. Many
            needs must be met in the existing, fragmented healthcare setting which includes a
            network of interconnected information systems. </para>
        <para>Historically, the United States healthcare system has been composed of relatively
            autonomous organizations that maintain loose relationships in support of patient care.
            Patients typically visit one or more primary care clinicians and are frequently sent,
            along with orders and patient data, to specialists, laboratories, and other care teams.
            The observation and interpretation of patients’ healthcare data across these settings is
            crucial to the processes of making safe clinical decisions, tracking patient outcomes,
            anticipating future health problems, identifying deviations from expected trends,
            informing preventive and public health measures, supporting clinical research, and
            providing a legal and historical record. [6] </para>
        <para>To provide context with an example, when a primary care provider records a diabetes
            diagnosis in their local system, it is critical for that system to share the data
            accurately and seamlessly to the pertinent pharmacy and laboratory systems. These
            systems must then in turn communicate with one another and with the primary care system
            to alert the provider that the patient has previously been prescribed gentamicin and has
            recently been given an order for a radiologic examination that requires intravenous
            iodine dye – both of which are known to affect kidney function. If this information is
            not accurately communicated across healthcare settings in a way that can be readily
            accessed, the patient may face unnecessary harm or risks that could have been avoided. </para>
        <para>The following sections aim to spell out some of the current problems with electronic
            health data more clearly: </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">The Need for Unmatched Precision </emphasis></para>
        <para>The degree to which data must maintain precision in healthcare is unmatched in other
            industries. Health data is unique in its direct association with a person’s health
            outcomes. Nuanced concepts exist in patient care settings creating challenges for the
            representation thereof in data capture and transmission. Laboratory testing on a
            specimen involves a plethora of biological concepts which must be represented by data in
            a meaningful way while maintaining precision as well as consumption for other entities
            or systems in the ecosystem. When an association to a patient’s health outcomes is
            combined with such nuanced concepts, exceptional rigor must be taken in the maintenance
            of data precision and representation. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">The Size, Scale, and Complexity of the System</emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>The ecosystem of healthcare entities, which share responsibility in the delivery of
            care, is vast. Various stakeholders include government health authorities, EHR
            companies, medical device manufacturers, health insurance companies, medical
            laboratories, hospitals and healthcare systems, and clinical providers among various
            site types. A healthcare entity’s data requirements differ in context from other
            industries regarding the facilitation of patient care and handling of health data in
            methods that are specific to their context. Industries such as transportation and
            logistics are more confined to a common context for the data required to successfully
            facilitate operations. The array of contexts for healthcare entities creates an unsolved
            challenge for interpreting and exchanging data without compromising its intended
            meaning. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">The Lack of Adherence and Enforcement of Standards
            </emphasis></para>
        <para>Standards in healthcare exist to promote successful interpretation and exchange of
            data; however, they are not enforced and can experience poor adherence in practice,
            undercutting their effectiveness and purpose. Despite a significant history of emphasis
            on healthcare data standards, entities continue to leverage proprietary, or localized,
            methods for data representation creating inherent and avoidable challenges in care
            delivery, reporting, and the meaningful application of available technology. Motivations
            for proprietary or localized data methods cannot be confirmed, however, considerations
            include protection of market share from competitors and avoidance of public scrutiny for
            misalignment to standard processes. Maintaining alignment with standards development
            organizations (SDOs) is resource intensive and invites SDOs to measure and scrutinize an
            organization against the standard processes to which an entity claims conformity. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">The Inability to Share Between Systems</emphasis></para>
        <para> Numerous distinct systems and organizations across the healthcare ecosystem lead to a
            large variation in how data are handled, e.g., data collection, data manipulation, data
            transmission, data storage, and real-world application. Each system has a proprietary,
            standard, or ad-hoc information model and is typically configured to satisfy
            organization-specific needs, resulting in differences in data handling within systems.
            While this variation is not an innate issue, the difficulty exchanging data between
            systems and the lack of interoperability compromises data quality and ultimately patient
            safety. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">The Significant Variation in Types of Data Needed</emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>Medical data range in format from narrative and textual data to numerical
            measurements, images, drawings, and more. It is common practice for several different
            observations of a singular patient to be made concurrently, the observation of the same
            patient parameter to be made over the course of several points in time, or both. [6] It
            is also important to keep a record of the circumstances under which data are obtained,
            further adding to the complexity and volume of data. For example, a simple blood
            pressure reading may factor if a blood pressure reading is taken on the arm or the leg,
            whether the patient recently exercised, and what kind of device was used. </para>
        <para>Current approaches for representing data from various, disparate health information
            systems introduce additional opportunities for inefficiencies, redundancies, and
            inconsistencies. Unpredictable and denormalized data formats reduce the quality of data
            processing and the ability to conduct safe and reliable analytics. When incongruent data
            is repeatedly collated, it requires extensive expertise and resources to synthesize
            basic trends, information, and insights that should be readily available. A history of
            numerous scholarly and practical efforts illustrates the challenges of using
            observational data for safe patient care, comparative effectiveness research, and
            analyses for biases, workflow differences, and issues with variations in data
            collection, such as invalid, inconsistent, and missing data. [7 – 22] </para>

        <title>A Brief Overview of Health Data Standards</title>
        <para>Standards are generally required when excessive variation creates inefficiencies or
            impedes effectiveness. [6] There have been many valuable standards applied throughout
            history such as railroad tracks, telephones, WiFi, and financial transactions. The broad
            goal of the application of standards to electronic health data is unambiguous data
            exchange, or “interoperability” – the ability of two parties, either human or machine,
            to exchange data or information so that it is transportable, organizable, and
            interpretable in an expected format. </para>
        <para>Standards for electronic health data have existed since the creation of the EHR in the
            1960s. Computer engineers responsible for EHR development were tasked with representing
            health concepts in a digital format that could be shared with users and connected
            systems for common interpretation. In 1965, the Systematized Nomenclature of Pathology
            (SNOP) was developed to provide a common way to describe morphology and anatomy. A
            decade later, SNOP expanded into its known name today, Systematized Nomenclature of
            Medicine (SNOMED). As the adoption of EHRs increased during the 1980s, Health Level
            Seven International (HL7) was formed in 1987 as a non-profit, American National
            Standards Institute (ANSI)-accredited standards development organization to develop
            standards that provide global health data interoperability. Since then, several SDOs in
            the healthcare space have appeared and, along with HL7 and SNOMED, continued to commit
            resources to the development and adoption of standardized health data processes. In
            2004, under the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Office
            of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) was born to promote
            a national health information technology infrastructure and oversee its development.
            While ONC is not an SDO, it works in close coordination with SDOs to support the
            adoption and application of health data standards in the U.S. </para>
        <para>While interoperable health data is a complex and nuanced topic, a primary component is
            maintaining the meaning and intent of clinical data from the point of consumption
            throughout the transmission and use of that data across various systems. As data is
            exchanged within and between multiple healthcare systems, the original provider’s
            meaning and intent must be electronically communicated in a way that, upon receipt,
            receiving systems and providers can understand in an identical manner. Data exchange
            standards provide a formal process for defining specific constructs to be exchanged
            between machines and must be used to support this seamless transfer of data. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Structure and Meaning </emphasis></para>
        <para>In simple terms, Structure and Meaning are two considerations to ensure data maintains
            its full integrity and can be communicated in a way that supports interoperability. </para>
        <para><emphasis>Structure</emphasis> is the ability of systems to agree on how to format the
            data. Structural interoperability ensures the seamless communication of the data’s
            structure between systems but does not guarantee that the receiving system will
            interpret the data with the original intent. Web pages, for instance, are developed
            using HTML or XML to ensure structural interoperability. While this guarantees a web
            page can be read by any machine with a web browser, it does not ensure the meaning of
            that page is identical across machines. There are a variety of healthcare structural
            standards, including Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR), Health Level
            Seven (HL7) Version 2 Messaging (HL7 v2), and Consolidated Clinical Document
            Architecture (C-CDA). </para>
        <para>To understand structural interoperability, consider the two sentences below. While
            both sentences have the same sentence structure, their meanings are completely different
            and only one makes logical sense. </para>
        <para><inlinemediaobject>

            </inlinemediaobject></para>
        <para><emphasis>Figure 1: “Structural” Interoperability Example</emphasis></para>
        <para>Meaning is the ability of systems to share the same interpretation of the data.
            Meaning interoperability ensures the original meaning and intent of data is interpreted
            identically across all parties but allows for structural variance. When people and
            systems use different words and codes to describe synonymous or related things,
            healthcare meaning standards translate the data to a common meaning. Healthcare
            terminology and meaning standards include Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical
            Terms (SNOMED CT®), the Logical Observation Identifiers, Names, and Codes (LOINC®) and
            RxNorm (a terminology defining medications and ingredients from the National Library of
            Medicine). </para>
        <para><inlinemediaobject>

            </inlinemediaobject></para>
        <para><emphasis>Figure 2: “Meaning” Interoperability Example</emphasis></para>
        <para>In the below example, the two sentences share a common meaning, however the sentence
            structure varies drastically. While Figure 1 and 2 intend to illustrate structure and
            meaning simply, a more real-world example like, “the patient was given pain medication”
            and “the patient was given medication for pain,” highlights potential issues when
            determining equivalence. Objectively, the two sentences do not follow the same
            structure; however, they may or may not have the same meaning depending on your
            perspective or interpretation. The first sentence could be read to mean “the provider
            prescribed the patient pain medication to address pain” or that “the patient acquired
            pain medication from another source other than the provider.” The complex relationship
            between these two concepts can lead to confusion and will need to be addressed to
            accurately characterize equivalence. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Example of Overlapping and Intersecting Nature of Standards
            </emphasis></para>
        <para>Hospitals and independent reference labs are two primary entities in the health data
            ecosystem which share direct relationships and interfaces in the exchange of clinical
            data. Healthcare interfaces must leverage various existing standards for structure and
            meaning and use them together in integrated ways. An electronic interface provides an
            avenue, or connection point, for sharing data in a meaningful, coherent way between two
            disparate systems. Without an interface, two disparate systems are unable to communicate
            in a common language. In the U.S. and elsewhere, the most common and accepted messaging
            structural standard for EHR-to- Reference Lab interfacing is the Health Level Seven
            (HL7) Version 2.x (V2.x) standard. While other messaging standards exist and can be
            used, the HL7 V2.x messaging standard, first released in 1987, is used in 95% of U.S.
            healthcare organizations and in more than 35 countries. [23] </para>
        <para>To illustrate how standards for structure and meaning may be currently implemented, we
            will explore a scenario of a typical hospital-to-reference lab order message generated
            by a hospital EHR system sent electronically to a Reference Lab. This laboratory order
            message is received, processed, and acted upon by which the laboratory will perform the
            test specified in the order message received. After a laboratory test is performed and a
            test result is available, the Reference Laboratory in this scenario will return a
            Laboratory Result message to the hospital EHR system. </para>
        <para>Figure 3 below shows an example of an HL7 v2 Observation (OBX) segment from two
            different mock lab result messages. In this scenario, a laboratory has conducted two
            distinct blood glucose tests on two distinct specimen sources. For the first test, a
            specimen from serum or plasma was used. For the second test, the specimen was from whole
            blood. The figure below illustrates how the HL7 v2 structure standard is populated using
            existing terminology standards for meaning, in this case LOINC. In the first HL7 segment
            for test 1, the LOINC code is for a “Glucose [Mass/volume] in Serum or Plasma”, whereas
            for test 2, the LOINC code is for a “Glucose [Mass/volume] in Blood”. Different tests
            were conducted and therefore different LOINC codes were used in the HL7 v2 messages. The
            local laboratory information system and EHR also define and use their own code systems
            to encode the tests; these are called “local codes.” Although not universal, local codes
            are another way for health information systems to represent meaning for clinical
            concepts. The HL7 v2 observation data in Figure 3 shows blue text representing a local
            code, and the observation data denoted in red represents a corresponding LOINC code. </para>
        <para><inlinemediaobject>
                <imageobject>
                    <imagedata fileref="images/Erroneous%20Loinc%20Mapping.png"/>
                </imageobject>
            </inlinemediaobject></para>
        <para><emphasis>Figure 3: Erroneous LOINC Mapping</emphasis></para>
        <para>The figure shows how the same local code can be erroneously mapped to different LOINC
            codes and transmitted in a Lab Result message. In this case example we see the same
            laboratory conducting two distinct tests and encoding each test with a different LOINC
            code; however, both are mapped to the same local code. This mock scenario highlights one
            example of the myriad of interoperability challenges faced in healthcare today. [23]
            Successful interoperability is dependent on either using universal code systems for data
            capture or through mapping local content to a universal code system. Local code systems
            serve the same function as universal coding systems such as SNOMED CT and LOINC, however
            are internal identification schemas that consist of a set of local codes and their
            associated definitions. </para>
        <para>Because the receiving system will parse the identical local codes from the two mock
            HL7 v2 segments above, it will interpret the lab result as having been produced from
            identical lab tests. In simpler terms, the receiving system will interpret these
            messages as the same glucose test with a “count of 2 observations” rather than two
            different glucose tests, each with a “count of 1 observation.” Since the source specimen
            and lab tests are different, but represented identically in the data transmission,
            semantic meaning is lost compromising patient safety and accurate reporting. The
            receiving system will interpret these two HL7 v2 segments as meaning the “same thing” or
            representing the “same glucose test”; however, any terminologist or laboratory
            professional would interpret this as “different glucose tests.” </para>
        <para>To improve the quality and safety of patient care, there is a need to refine data
            exchange within the healthcare ecosystem. We often hear comments like, “Why is the
            problem of data exchange in healthcare so difficult? After all, other
            industries—banking, for example— have solved the problem. Healthcare transactions can’t
            be that much more complicated than those managed by a geographically distributed,
            multiple line-of-business banking system.” </para>
        <para>While other industries, like banking, have resolved issues with their transmission and
            exchange of complex banking data across geographical locations and between numerous
            unaffiliated businesses, the complexity with healthcare data arises, in part, because
            neither the standards for structure (i.e., statement model) nor standards for meaning
            (i.e., terminology model) can represent clinical data alone in the current data
            structures. Both types of models can be arbitrarily complex, and, at some point,
            semantics not represented in one must be represented in the other if one is to achieve
            interoperability. [6] </para>

        <title>The Need for Change</title>
        <para>The current practice of relying on standards alone is not enough to adequately enhance
            the healthcare and laboratory ecosystems of EHRs, LISs, and ancillary systems.
            Healthcare providers agree that the current implementation of EHRs is not reaching its
            full potential–44% see EHRs as data storage or data collection methods only. [5] </para>
        <para>The issues outlined in the sections above begin to illustrate the current state of
            knowledge management, or the process of identifying, organizing, storing and
            disseminating information, within the healthcare sector. While many individual
            organizations (e.g., EHR vendors, hospital systems, clinical laboratories) make valid
            claims that information flows seamlessly within their internal systems, matters of life
            and death are not confined within a single system or set of knowledge. <emphasis
                role="bold">To achieve an altogether higher quality healthcare system, there is an
                urgent need for coordination and integration of knowledge management practices
                across and between institutions. </emphasis></para>
        <para>This concept of Integrated Knowledge Management, as it is referred to in the title of
            this book, is a strategy intended to bring together the disparate pieces and knowledge
            management practices employed in the healthcare ecosystem. By creating and adhering to a
            shared set of ideals and standards interwoven throughout data governance and management
            processes, information can move more freely through and between systems, resulting in
            higher quality and more reliable patient outcomes. </para>
        <para>The examples in this introduction touched on the errors, gaps, as well as the missed
            potential of data standardization and EHRs. Throughout the ensuing chapters, this book
            will clearly outline previous and ongoing challenges that will serve as building blocks
            for novel research that ultimately highlights the powerful potential of EHRs and other
            healthcare information systems when data standardization, harmonization, and
            interoperability is achieved. </para>

        <title>Purpose of This Document</title>
        <para>This book will act as 1) a reference for understanding the complex, multi-layered, and
            highly inter-dependent Health IT landscape, and 2) a framework for the implementation of
            a layered, architecture-based approach to integrating and managing knowledge in the
            healthcare ecosystem that will seek to solve the previously identified issues. </para>
        <para>This framework, referred to throughout this book as the Knowledge Architecture, is a
            methodology seeking to enable the concept of Integrated Knowledge Management throughout
            the healthcare ecosystem. </para>
        <para>Through examples and illustrations, this book seeks to demonstrate that such an
            approach for managing knowledge will allow for: </para>
        <para>1. The ability to recognize equivalence between different standards that are
            representing the same clinical data, </para>
        <para>2. The ability to represent clinically significant concepts that are needed in a
            system of record, such as an EHR or LIS, unambiguously, </para>
        <para>3. The ability to prevent the inclusion and/or perpetuation of errors in clinical data
            represented within healthcare systems of record, and </para>
        <para>4. The ability to ensure the safe and reliable evolution of terminology standards,
            solutions, and processes as new technologies and policies are implemented. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Guiding Principles</emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>The following key principles are critical in our summarization and discussion of
            Integrated Knowledge Management. </para>
        <para>Functional decomposition—often referred to as a Separation of Concerns (SoC)—across
            components or sections with a specific purpose is a foundational design principle for
            complex system architecture. SoC allows a complete system to be subdivided into distinct
            sections or components with well-defined functionality and dependencies. If successful,
            this approach allows individual sections to be reused, as well as designed, implemented,
            and updated independently to address emerging requirements. This is especially useful
            and important in a medical context given how many different health information and
            clinical terminology projects are ongoing at any given time. Efforts are often
            uncoordinated and led by disparate and unrelated standards development organizations. In
            these cases, SoC allows teams to simultaneously work independently and in coordination
            with each other and reuse the resulting artifacts. </para>
        <para>The architecture presented in this book is inspired by core evolutionary design
            principles called “Understandable, Reproducible, and Useful,” upon which SNOMED CT
            development is still based. [24, 25] These criteria describe an approach for improving
            data quality and increasing data integrity and agility: </para>
        <para>• <emphasis role="bold">Understandable</emphasis>: The content can be processed by
            health IT systems and understood by most healthcare providers without reference to
            private or inaccessible information.</para>
        <para>• <emphasis role="bold">Reproducible</emphasis>: Multiple users or systems apply the
            data to the same situations and source data with an equivalent result.</para>
        <para> • <emphasis role="bold">Useful</emphasis>: Data is fit-for-purpose – it has practical
            value for data analysis in support of health information exchange, research, and public
            health that requires information aggregation across health IT systems. </para>
        <para>In order to produce highly reliable software, the following tenets must be applied
            within a tooling’s software development methodology: Use-case driven,
            architecture-centric, iterative and incremental. </para>
        <para>• <emphasis role="bold">Use-case Driven</emphasis>: Defining, developing, and refining
            software design(s) to meet known and emerging use cases enable software solutions to
            meet critical real-world needs. </para>
        <para>• <emphasis role="bold">Architecture-centric</emphasis>: Formally documenting the
            “layers” of capabilities that a software system may have enables developers to identify
            dependencies between layers, allowing for shared responsibility of reducing functional
            complexity across the entire software solution. </para>
        <para>• <emphasis role="bold">Iterative and Incremental</emphasis>: Similar to the Agile
            mindset, developing software solutions should in small, iterative, and incremental ways
            thus affording time to perform adequate Independent Validation and Verification (IV and
            V) methodologies. IV and V methodologies include general-purpose validation approaches
            conducted by an organization that is not involved in development to generate metrics for
            data and software quality. From a health information exchange perspective, IV and V can
            help compare and test source data against requirements of a destination system through
            manual, semi-automated, and automated inspection of source-to-destination data reviews,
            thereby helping ensure a sound data strategy intended to reduce patient safety risk and
            improve data quality for analysis and tracking. [26] </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">The Knowledge Architecture </emphasis></para>
        <para>Increased reliance on computerized health records, including EHRs Systems, requires
            standardized medical terminology to encode health information consistently across
            systems and enterprises. Clinicians require not only objective quantitative measurements
            (e.g., 90 beats per minute for a patient’s pulse), but also procedural context (e.g.,
            pulse oximetry, manual) about past observations or requests for future interventions.
            While two quantitative measurements may be the same, the procedural information could
            indicate meaningful semantic differences and lead to different clinical interpretation
            and treatment. As information is exchanged across systems, the solution requires a
            common understanding of data, a method to support knowledge representation, and clinical
            decision rules based on common terminology and statements. Each component must address
            an aspect and together need to address the requirements of clinicians. Current HL7
            standard implementations rely on profiles and templates to disambiguate statement and
            terminology and provide sufficient precision for transactions, documents, and
            standards-based APIs. Therefore, the architectural approach described here is applicable
            to standards organizations developing interoperability for enterprise and
            project-specific implementations in equal measure. </para>
        <para>The Knowledge Architecture, by definition, is a framework for clinical information
            that is organized into distinct layers such that each higher layer relies upon artifacts
            from the lower layer. The purpose of the Knowledge Architecture is to standardize
            clinical statements and terminologies by providing abstraction eliminating unnecessary
            complexity. It helps to do this by: </para>
        <para>• <emphasis role="bold">Integrating essential clinical terminologies into a coherent
                integrated system</emphasis>: </para>
        <para>o Localized terminology specific to one organization or system </para>
        <para>o EHR Vendor Terminologies (such as Cerner's Code Sets, Event Codes, Event Set
            Hierarchy) </para>
        <para>o Interoperability standards: SNOMED, LOINC, RxNorm, and similar </para>
        <para>• <emphasis role="bold">Defining a Standardized Form for clinical
                statements</emphasis>: </para>
        <para>o Reduce unnecessary complexity and improve logical structure </para>
        <para>o Create a coherent integrated healthcare data system </para>
        <para>o Create an analysis normal form for clinical statements </para>
        <para>The proposed architecture, shown visually below, serves as an implementation of SoC,
            and helps to break out and organize inter-dependent types of knowledge in a way that
            allows for reuse, ongoing development, and independent updates. If employed, this model
            can help the healthcare ecosystem to individually resolve issues in their data within
            their layers, rather than the entire system, leading to much more agile
            improvement.</para>

        <para><emphasis>Figure 4: Knowledge Architecture</emphasis></para>
        <para>Detailed descriptions of each layer will be spelled out in the chapters that follow,
            but brief descriptions of each can be found below: </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Foundational Architecture</emphasis> – The foundational layer of
            the Knowledge Architecture provides the common elements of interoperability, such as:
            object identity, versioning, modularity, and knowledge representation. It includes (a)
            the foundation and building blocks of the common model; (b) how the repeatable
            transformation process of disparate standards into the common model promotes
            interoperability with other environments; and (c) how the modules of the architecture
            are tightly version controlled over time. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Terminology Knowledge</emphasis> – The terminology knowledge
            layer is responsible for structured sets of medical terms and codes that define concepts
            of interest, including descriptions, dialects, language, and semantic hierarchy. SNOMED
            CT®, LOINC®, and RxNorm are part of this layer. It defines what valid codes or
            expressions may be used by higher level layers. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Statement Model</emphasis> – The statement model layer is
            responsible for defining how data elements are combined to create a statement. This
            layer reuses the artifacts defined in the terminology knowledge layer. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Assertional Knowledge</emphasis> – The assertional knowledge
            layer makes use of the Terminology Knowledge layer concepts to specify non-defining
            facts that may be used by procedural knowledge algorithms. An example fact might be that
            “thiazide diuretics treat hypertension.” Assertional knowledge may also indicate what
            symptoms may be associated with a disorder. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Procedural Knowledge</emphasis> – The procedural knowledge
            layer, also known as imperative knowledge, is the knowledge exercised in the performance
            of some task. An example would be determining a hypertension treatment plan by analyzing
            a combination of a patient’s clinical statements and the available assertional
            knowledge. The procedural knowledge is responsible for information about standard ways
            to carry out specific procedures, as well as other procedural guidelines, (e.g.,
            treatment protocols for diseases and order sets focused on certain patient situations).
            Procedural knowledge, together with assertional knowledge, enables clinical decision
            support, quality measurement, and patient safety. This layer relies on the architectural
            foundation and terminology layers, incorporates the statement model for information
            retrieval, and uses assertional knowledge. Procedural knowledge artifacts may include
            clinical alert rules, reminders, etc., that trigger actions or recommend
            interventions.</para>
        <para>Examining a clinical procedure for controlling hypertension illustrates each of the
            layers of the informatics architectural separation of concerns. </para>
        <para>• At the terminology knowledge layer, there may be various codes and terms from
            disparate source terminologies to define a concept (e.g., hypertension). Ideally, these
            overlapping codes and terms would be oriented to the same parent concept during the
            transformation and integration process at the foundational architecture layer. </para>
        <para>• The statement model layer enables representation of blood pressure measurement
            values (e.g., systolic BP = 140 mmHg), or the categorical data (e.g., pregnancy induced
            hypertension vs. renal hypertension) within a standard data structure to facilitate
            information exchange or retrieval, such as within a standards-based clinical statement
            (i.e., FHIR). </para>
        <para>• The assertional knowledge layer represents non-procedural statements, or facts, such
            as “Stage 2 high blood pressure is over 140 systolic or 90 diastolic,” or “beta-blockers
            and ACE inhibitors may be used to treat hypertension”, or “beta-blockers are
            contraindicated in patients with a diagnosis of reactive airway disease.” </para>
        <para>• Finally, the procedural knowledge layer provides algorithms to analyze clinical
            statements about a patient, in combination with the assertional knowledge, to recommend
            a treatment protocol for different kinds of hypertension, including the considerations
            of, (e.g., patient age, co-morbidities etc., which can be generated by an electronic
            clinical decision support system [statement + assertional layers]). This layer adds
            support for workflow and conditional logic (i.e., if-then-else). </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Benefits of an Integrated Approach</emphasis>
        </para>
        <para>Implementing Integrated Knowledge Management will reduce the challenges associated
            with unpredictable, poorly controlled, and reactive health IT data. The Knowledge
            Architecture described above will provide the foundation for robust configuration
            management and quality assurance of health IT data while allowing for a standardized
            update and extension process. This approach will support increased clinical and
            laboratory data quality and enable healthcare systems across the industry to conduct
            robust and meaningful data analysis and increase overall interoperability, which
            ultimately enhances the quality of care across all medical facilities. </para>
        <para>The purpose of employing the Knowledge Architecture and enabling Integrated Knowledge
            Management can be succinctly described through its benefits: improved patient outcomes,
            meaningful data analysis, and increased interoperability. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Improved Patient Outcomes </emphasis></para>
        <para>Patient care will be optimized and efficient, enabling clinicians to provide
            high-quality care to all patients across all medical facilities. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Meaningful Data Analysis </emphasis></para>
        <para>Medical facilities will be able to easily query specific health factors to gain
            necessary insights, draw conclusions, and make recommendations based on accurate patient
            data. </para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Increased Interoperability </emphasis></para>
        <para>Medical facilities will have more interoperable capabilities, opening the door for
            future opportunities to integrate patient data with other agencies, community partners,
            and the private sector. </para>
