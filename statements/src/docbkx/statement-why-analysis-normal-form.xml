  <title>Why Analysis Normal Form? A Normal Form for Clinical Statements</title>
  <para>A <glossterm baseform="Clinical Statement">clinical statement</glossterm> is a definite and
    clear representation of a clinically-significant fact or situation that was observed to exist or
    happened. A clinical statement can be expressed as a <glossterm baseform="Statement Narrative"
      >narrative</glossterm> that provides a written account that can be naturally read by humans,
    as well as a <glossterm baseform="Normal Form">normal form</glossterm> which is a
    machine-processable representation of the statement's data as a standardized and encoded
    fundamental form. Today, clinical statements are often represented in unpredictable and
    denormalized forms, which makes reliable and safe decision support challenging, and reduces the
    quality of other types of data processing. </para>

    of EHR systems is nearly ubiquitous in the US and there is increasing opportunity to leverage
    standards-based clinical statements<!--a substantial number of extant EHR mapped data sets--> to
    improve population health through quality measures, case reporting, and decision support. The
    ability to measure and improve outcomes relies on consistent, high-quality data that was

      systems record and manage clinical statements using a variety of standard or ad-hoc models.
      However, both treatment and analysis of clinical statements require consistency not only at
      the format level (e.g. <glossterm>CDA</glossterm>, FHIR, V2) but also the content model (i.e.
      an instance of an <link xlink:href="https://www.iso.org/standard/62416.html"><glossterm
          baseform="ISO/TS Detailed Clinical Models">ISO/TS 13972</glossterm></link> DCM, CIMI
      model, etc.). [5] In most cases the data quality is the greatest obstacle to analysis, but
      even in the case of structured, semantically-clear information, inconsistency across sources
      of information raises obstacles to analysis. Analysis of aggregate information managed by
      health information networks poses the greatest challenge today because a meaningful use of
      data for patient outcomes or research requires a common format, semantic clarity, and quality
      data.<?oxy_comment_end?></para>

      only is there a potential for a lack of consistency with representing clinical statements with
      current <glossterm baseform="Detailed Clinical Model">detailed clinical modeling</glossterm>
      efforts, but there is also further variation in how the data is entered into information
      systems by end-users. This reality has a direct impact on patient safety if a clinical
      statement is recorded and displayed differently across the continuum of care. Clinicians
      author clinical statements and enter them into their organization’s EHR systems where they are
      represented as some type of <glossterm baseform="Structured Clinical Input Forms">"Clinical
        Input Form"</glossterm> (CIF). This concept describes the representation of any natural
      language processing or data entry mechanism used by clinicians to record clinical statements.
      Vendors may compete on usability which may result in proprietary CIF data, or, clinical
      statements are based on standards-based models (e.g. CIMI, openEHR archetypes). For the
      purposes of this document, the type or usability of CIF data structures are not in scope. We
      assume that <emphasis role="bold">any suitably encoded</emphasis> clinical statement may be
      normalized. <?oxy_comment_end?></para>
    <para>Ideally, clinical information is modeled in a manner that is most efficient for use. This
      is a problem because there are many different use cases for clinical information with a wide
      range of requirements. There is no single model that can be the most efficient model for all
      the various use cases. Maximum efficiency for each use case necessitates that any particular
      clinical information be available in multiple modeled forms. These models, although different
      in form, semantically represent the same information, and are known as <glossterm
        baseform="Isosemantic Model">isosemantic models</glossterm>. Any particular detailed
      clinical model exists within a family of isosemantic siblings. </para>
    <para>Clinical statements can be expressed and documented in many different ways in EHR systems,
      where clinical input forms provide different options to document the same clinical statement.
      These differences pose challenges for how the data is modeled, how the data is stored, and
      therefore has implications on data retrieval, data analysis, and accuracy of clinical analysis
      results. </para>
