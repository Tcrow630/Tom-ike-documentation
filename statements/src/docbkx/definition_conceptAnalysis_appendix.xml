        <title>Reliability of Rule Sets<?oxy_comment_end?></title>
        <para>In order to determine reliability of the identified keywords and rule sets for each
            Assemblage, metrics of agreement/disagreement for the initial review were used.</para>
        <para>After the first two Terminologists reviewed the 50,000 SNOMED CT concepts
            individually, applying the initial set of rules for each Assemblage. After this first
            review, disagreements between the two Terminologists were extracted from the concept
            files and re-assigned for discussion and reconciliation. </para>

            <para>In the course of the reconciliation discussion, the initial rules were
                re-evaluated and either confirmed, adjusted, clarified or eliminated to achieve a
                set of rules that is sufficiently expressive and reproducible.</para>
            <para>The Assemblage membership status of all reconciled concepts was updated in the
                Assemblages.</para>
            <para>The following metrics for agreement/disagreement percentages between the first two

        <para>Using the defined set of keywords the sensitivity and specificity of the initial
            automated queries was tested against the final Assemblages. By running the queries
            against the original 50,000 concepts the following metrics were applied to the results: <itemizedlist>

                if the attribute had a laterality where the value was the parent (side) of right and
                left, those concepts were considered to be within the set that probably did not
                include laterality. If the concept was associated with a laterality attribute that
                was either right or left, it was considered as a probable concept that includes
                laterality whether it was correctly modelled or not.</para>

        <para>The reproducibility of the rules stated and applied during the two manual review
            cycles was perceived positive. </para>

        <para>For "Absence",
            "<?oxy_comment_start author="steph" timestamp="20190312T163219-0600" comment="Should this be revised to &quot;Patient not subject of information&quot;?" flag="done"?>Patient
            not subject<?oxy_comment_end?> of information" and "Compound Observation" Assemblages,
            the set of keywords for automated queries returned results with a high rate of
            Specificity. The Sensitivity for the “Compound Observation” Assemblage was also high.
            However, the Sensitivity of the queries for “Absence” and “Patient not Subject of
            Information” was lower. Identifying additional keywords may be useful to elevate the
            Sensitivity in those categories.</para>
        
        <para>The Inverse Assemblages had good inter-rater agreement but the Fully Defined and
            Laterality Assemblages had lower inter-rater agreement rates. The Fully Defined and
            Laterality Assemblages both required the evaluation of the modeling of the defining
            relationships and judging their correctness. The experience of the clinical reviewing
            team with the SNOMED CT Concept Model is critical to getting a high inter-rater
            agreement rate when creating Assemblages that depend on reviewing modelling. As the
            SNOMED CT Concept Model increases in complexity, the education and experience with
            modelling of SNOMED CT concepts will become even more critical in reviewing and
            maintaining these Assemblages. </para>
        <para>For the 5,069 concepts that were identified as having laterality, 33.79% were deemed
            to be incorrectly modeled. While this is a rather large number, SNOMED International is
            currently modeling a large number of laterality concepts and this number should be
            decreasing with each release. </para>
        <para>The sensitivity for the Primitive Assemblages is relatively low because reviewers
            needed to decide if the addition of some qualifier value or a new parent concept would
            make these concepts definable. In many cases there needed to be the addition of a new
            concept model attribute to fully define concepts. The queries used to identify these
            concepts for review were not able to tell which primitive concepts could be fully
            defined with and without Concept Model changes. Overall, the exercise of reviewing
            primitives is very useful to identify more concepts that could be fully defined. </para>
                
        <para>Overall, this approach to identify SNOMED CT concepts that require special handling
            shows that automated queries can be very useful as a first “screening” step, but manual
            review and reconciliation still has to be performed to arrive at evaluated Assemblages
            that adhere to reliable inclusion/exclusion criteria. Creating Assemblages that identify
            modeling issues can present problems when the review of concepts spans multiple release
            dates and the tooling used to do the review is updated while the review is still taking
            place. This requires additional work at the end of the project to ensure that the review
            of the concepts for errors does not identify concepts that were correctly placed when
            they were initially reviewed, but are now incorrectly placed due to corrections or
            changes made to the latest release.</para>
