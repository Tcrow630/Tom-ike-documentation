     <title>Self and External Assessment Evaluation Approach for Laboratory Data Coding
        Quality</title>
    <section><title>Self-Assessment Evaluation Approach for Laboratory Data Coding Quality</title>
        <para>Replacing vendor-developed custom codes with existing standard ontology codes and
        incorporatingthese codes into the LIS and EHR system will require a change in workflow as
        well as maintenance of coding to ensure their continued accuracy. It is to be expected that
        standard coding systems will require periodic updates to provide for the orderly release of
        new codes, revision of existing codes to correct errors and the deprecation of out-of-date
        codes. The current workflow for most labs is to perform mapping of local tests to
        standardized codes infrequently with very rare updating of codes. These mapping activities
        usually coincide with the addition of a new test to the laboratory menu, implementation of a
        new LIS or EHR system or to satisfy the requirements of a clinical trial, public health
        reporting requirement or clinician needs.</para>
        <para>Theproposed strategy of advancing laboratory interoperability hinges on utilizing a set of
        standardized codes to digitally represent laboratory test results. For each IVD platform,
        the following codes will be enumerated for each test the IVD has FDA approval for
        use:</para>

    <para>This strategy is predicated on the assumption that the healthcare ecosystem infrastructure
        will be able to capture and transmit these standardized data elements and that the coding
        will be accurate and up-to- date. While the first assumption will be explored elsewhere in
        this document, this section touches on the requiredtools that will need to be developed to
        aid laboratory personnel in the upkeep of coding to ensure their continued accuracy and
        quality. These tools will need to minimize the administrative burden on laboratory personnel
        and include:</para>

            <title>Laboratory Interoperability Data Repository (LIDR)</title>
            <para>The Laboratory Interoperability Data Repository is intended to serve as a
                centralized repository of standardized codes that have been curated by IVD vendors
                for their menu of test offerings. LIDR would serve as the authoritative source of
                truth for the digital representation of any IVD test. To serve this
                intendedfunction, LIDR must be easily accessible to laboratory personnel to query
                for the prescriptive list of standardized codes for test order and analytes,
                specimen source and types, result values (nominal and ordinal), and instrument and
                reagent kit information. The codes should be searchable by the combination of test
                and instrument vendor through a human searchable interface. It is envisioned that
                laboratory personnelcould access LIDR to query and download the curated codes for
                initial implementation of an assay and also to verify the accuracy of the coding for
                existing tests in their LIS/EHR system.</para>

        <section>
            <title>LIS/EHR Report Templates</title>
            <para>Although standardized codes intended to allow for interoperability of laboratory
                data has been in existence for decades, there remains significant variation in how
                these codes are incorporated into LIS/EHRsystems. Although the transmission of these
                codes in HL7 messages are relatively well-defined, the fields into which they are
                entered in LIS/EHR systems can vary significantly depending on which LIS or EHR
                system is utilized. In addition, a given assay offered by a laboratory requires the
                creation of numerous records in the LIS and EHR systems for the test to be
                orderable, billable, and performable. The LOINC code for the test order is likely to
                be contained in the record required for the test to be orderable through
                computerized order entry in the EHR, while the LOINC code for the performable test
                or analyte is usually contained in the test record created in the LIS that allows
                the laboratory to perform and report the results of the test. A test may be composed
                of a number of components, and each of these components may have a separate result
                with its own associated unit of measure or SNOMED-encoded qualitative results.
                Specimen information with SNOMED codes associated with the specimen type may be
                contained in its own record separate from the test record.</para>
            <para>For laboratory personnel to maintain the accuracy of coding in the LIS/EHR systems
                with minimal administrative burden, the standardized codes must be transparent and
                easily accessible to laboratory personnel. Transparency of coding is currently a
                challenge as these codes can be dispersed across a variety of LIS and EHR records as
                illustrated above. In addition, the standardized codes are not usually visible
                outside of these records, which are not accessible to most laboratory personnel. The
                coding and maintenance of these records are managed by information system analysts.
                To obtain these codes, laboratory personnel must request reports generated by the IS
                analysts. This may result in multiple reports that must be collated to present all
                the relevant codes in an understandable manner. LIS/EHR report templates specific to
                the LIS and/or EHR systems utilized by the laboratories would enable laboratoriesto
                perform self-assessments of their coding to identify errors and deprecated codes
                that need to be replaced. These report templates would be available as part of a
                self-assessment toolkit and would obviate the need for laboratories to formulate
                their own reports to see the coding in their system.</para>

            <title>Coding Change Request Templates</title>
            <para>Whenan error or code replacement is identified, it is essential that the code
                change occurs in an efficient manner to maintain data coding quality. As alluded to
                above, the LIS and EHR records that contain the standardized codes associated with a
                given assay are maintained by IS analysts. These analysts may be embedded within the
                laboratory, or more commonly, are part of the larger IS group that support the
                information technology needs for the entire enterprise or institution. These IS
                analysts may or may not have a laboratory background. Correction or replacement of
                codes requires clear communication between laboratory personnel who likely have no
                expertise with the LIS software and IS analysts who may be unfamiliar with
                laboratory processes.</para>
            <para>To minimize miscommunication that may arise with code change requests, code change
                request templates specific to the LIS or EHR system used by the laboratory could
                constitute part of the self- assessmenttoolkit provided to laboratories. The change
                request templates would ideally be a smart form that could display information on
                the standardized code that is being requested to be inserted into the LIS and EHR
                system as well as the record and field within the record that the code should be
                inserted.</para>
