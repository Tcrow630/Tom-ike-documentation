        <title>Introduction</title>
        <para>The Clinical Statement Type distinguishes between the performance of an action
            (“performed”) and a request for an action (“requested”). Both can be statements of
            procedures or interventions which are requested (ordered) for a patient or have been
            performed on a patient in the past. </para>

            <para></para>
        <para>In the context of the Solor ANF Model, the representation of procedures is comprised
            of the requested or performed procedure as the topic and a number of allowed
            circumstances, e.g. priority, frequency, duration and repetitions. Topic and
            circumstances are all codable concepts. Details about the ANF Model representation of
            procedures are discussed in Chapter xx</para>
