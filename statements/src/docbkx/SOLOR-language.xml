     <title>Solor language representation</title>
     <para/>
     <annotation><para>Cite "Negation" in this section. Note: Perhaps it will become clearer what "Language" means - but at this time, it seems like "Language" pertains to dialects and different languages (English, Spanish, etc). Notion of negation fits better in Definitional than in this section.</para></annotation>
