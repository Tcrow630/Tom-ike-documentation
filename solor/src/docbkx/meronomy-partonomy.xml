    <section>
        <title>Introduction</title>
        <para>Partonomy/Meronomy is a type of hierarchy that deals with part-whole relationships.
                <emphasis role="italic">Part-of</emphasis> Relationships are:</para>
        <para>
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Transitive – a part of a part is also a part of the whole, example
                        below:</para>
                    <itemizedlist>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>Atrioventricular junction: Part of = Entire Heart</para>
                        </listitem>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>Entire Heart: Part of = Entire heart and pericardium</para>
                        </listitem>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>Entire heart and pericardium: Part of = Entire middle mediastinum,
                                Part of = Entire cardiovascular system </para>
                            <para>Therefore, Atrioventricular junction is a part of the Entire heart
                                and pericardium, Entire middle mediastinum, and the entire
                                cardiovascular system.</para>
                        </listitem>
                    </itemizedlist>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Reflexive – a part is a part of itself</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Antisymmetric – nothing is a part of its parts</para>
                    <itemizedlist>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>The Entire Heart is not a part of the Atrioventricular
                                junction</para>
                        </listitem>
                    </itemizedlist>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
        </para>
        <para>For this task we will be evaluating the representation of <emphasis role="italic"
                >Part-of</emphasis> relationships in the Body Structure, Pharmaceutical/Biologic
            Product, and Laboratory Procedure (LOINC) hierarchies, and developing and testing a
            proposed model where appropriate.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Tooling</title>
        <para>To evaluate the proposed model for the three hierarchies, we will continue to use the
            termMed’s termSpace authoring tool. termSpace currently supports Object Properties with
            reflexive and transitive properties. For the Pharmaceutical/Biological Product
            hierarchy, we will use Nested Expressions to represent the powders used for injection
            solutions, as they do not currently exist as pre-coordinated concepts. termSpace can
            represent LOINC concepts to support the partonomy modeling of laboratory concepts;
            however, these concepts will need to be transformed into a SNOMED RF2 format in order to
            load them into termSpace. Due to the complexities of adding LOINC to termSpace we were
            not able to test the LOINC model at this time. We will continue to work with termMed to
            represent LOINC in termSpace to potentially test the model in future iterations.</para>

        <title>Body Structure Concepts</title>
        <para>There are currently 42,596 <emphasis role="italic">Part-of</emphasis> Relationships
            assigned to Body Structure concepts remaining from the 2003 decision to transform them
            to non-defining. </para>
        <para>SNOMED International is currently in discussions with Foundational Model of Anatomy
            (FMA) to collaborate on an anatomy model in SNOMED CT. SNOMED International is currently
            modeling <emphasis role="italic">Part-of</emphasis> relationships in a Protégé version
            of the Body Structure hierarchy; however, they are only exporting the resulting
                <emphasis role="italic">IS-A</emphasis> relationships. As a part of the <emphasis
                role="italic">IS-A</emphasis> and <emphasis role="italic">Part-of</emphasis>
            Modeling Subproject at SNOMED International, they plan to perform Quality Assurance (QA)
            to the <emphasis role="italic">Part-of</emphasis> relationships and assign
            sub-attributes of <emphasis role="italic">Part-of</emphasis>:<itemizedlist>

        <section>
            <title>Proposed Body Structure Model</title>
            <para>With the forthcoming update to the SNOMED CT Anatomy concept model, we do not
                recommend exploring this area for concept model work, but instead focus on the
                Pharmaceutical/Substance and Laboratory hierarchies, where no current implementation
                of partonomy is planned.</para>
        </section>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Pharmaceutical / Substance Concepts</title>
        <para>At this time, SNOMED project groups have not held a discussion around partonomy for
            Pharmaceutical/Substances. The most promising area where partonomy would apply within
            the Pharmaceutical Product hierarchy are products that are made up of two or more
            products, for example a package that contains two separate tablets. For example,
            Clarithromycin 500mg tablet and lansoprazole 30mg capsule would be considered parts of a
            concept like 317329000 |Clarithromycin 500mg tablet and lansoprazole 30mg capsule and
            amoxycillin 500mg capsule pack (product)|. Concepts like this are different from a
            single product that contains two or more active ingredients. These packages can be made
            of products that have different active ingredients or can be products that have the same
            active ingredient, but different strengths for each product in the package.</para>
        <section>
            <title>Proposed Pharmaceutical / Substance Model</title>
            <para>We propose to add a new attribute |Has packaging component (attribute)| that will
                take as a value another concept from the product hierarchy. This will be a <emphasis
                    role="italic">Part-of</emphasis> attribute and will need to be transitive and
                reflexive. These concepts will need to have a new hierarchy to live under as they
                are not really subtypes of the product that make up the packages but are packages
                that contain them. We suggest creating a new hierarchy named “Package” containing
                multiple products (product) and as needed create sub-hierarchies to ease
                navigation.</para>
            <para>Below are examples of the products that potentially require the addition of new
                product concepts in order for the new attribute to be modeled or require the use of
                nested expressions to represent the missing content. For our pilot work we
                represented these concepts using nested expressions, however if the model were
                implemented in the International Release of SNOMED CT it may require creating
                pre-coordinated concepts.<itemizedlist>
                    <listitem>
                        <para>Disodium etidronate 400mg tablet and calcium carbonate 1.25g
                            effervescent tablet pack (product) – Disodium etidronate 400mg tablet
                            and calcium carbonate 1.25g effervescent tablet exist and will be used
                            to fully define this concept. We need to determine the purpose of the
                            parent concept, 346404007 |Disodium etidronate+calcium carbonate

                            solvent is packaged separate from the powder. Being able to model the
                            solvent part + the powder part will allow for a fully defined
                            concept.</para>

            <para>There are some drugs, mainly multi-tablet packages that do have the individual
                clinical drugs represented as pre-coordinated concepts and will not require the use
                of a nested expression.<itemizedlist>

                            tablet and chloroquine phosphate 250mg tablet both exist as separate
                            pre-coordinated concepts and could be used to fully define this

                            pack. All three tablets exist as separate pre-coordinated concepts and
                            we could easily fully define this concepts with three separate “Has
                            packaging” components. </para>

        <para>Part-of Relationships will be useful in the definition of LOINC concepts that
            represent Panels. These panel concepts contain both individual laboratory tests and
            other panel concepts. Panels may also require multiple sufficient sets to represent
            tests that are not always a part of the panel but optional. </para>

        <section>
            <title>Proposed Laboratory Model</title>
            <para>We propose to add a new attribute that applies to concepts in the Observable
                Entity hierarchy named Contains lab test (attribute). This attribute will take other
                Observable Entity concepts as values and will be transitive and reflexive.</para>

            <para>To fully represent the information contained within the LOINC Panel spreadsheet an
                Ordered RefSet would have to be created because the tests contained in the panel are
                ordered in the spreadsheet.</para>
            <para>In order to represent the optional tests that are sometimes part of a Panel there
                are several options. These optional tests and panels could be represented in an
                Association Reference Set, but a better representation may be using multiple
                sufficient sets.</para>
