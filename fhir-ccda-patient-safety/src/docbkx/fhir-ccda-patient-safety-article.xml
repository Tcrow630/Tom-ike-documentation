        <title>Introduction</title>
        <para>Interoperability among clinical information systems remains a significant challenge
            for U.S. health care organizations, including the Veterans Health Administration and the
            Military Health System. Recently, the specification and growing adoption of two
            interoperability standards has raised the prospect of improved interoperability: The
            U.S. Core Implementation Guide for Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (US-FHIR)
            and the Consolidated CDA Implementation Guide for the Clinical Document Architecture
            (C-CDA). These implementation guides have become required or suggested standards for
            clinical data exchange under the CMS Meaningful Use Program for EHRs, and thereby have
            garnered considerable attention (and implementations) on the part of commercial EHR
            vendors and large healthcare organizations.</para>
        <para>As adoption and use of the US-FHIR and C-CDA implementation guides grow, healthcare
            organizations will exchange more real-world patient data encoded in the underlying data
            models of these standards. However, to date, no formal examination of these data models
            has been done with respect to their patient-safety implications. Specifically, to the
            degree that loss or misinterpretation of clinical data can adversely impact clinical
            care as patients move between health care organizations, the ability of these standard
            data models to fully, clearly, and unambiguously represent the clinical meaning of
            patient data has become important for ensuring patient safety and avoiding medical
            errors. </para>
        <para>This whitepaper examines several data-modeling characteristics of the US-FHIR and
            C-CDA standards that bear consideration from a patient-safety perspective. The issues
            include the standards’ inability to represent certain important information in a
            structured way, their propensity to represent certain important clinical information in
            unexpected and unrecognizable ways, and their manifestation of an excess complexity that
            increases the risks of misinterpreting important clinical data. Section <xref
                linkend="_Ref478481954"/> examines these issues with respect to the US-FHIR
            implementation guide, and Section <xref linkend="_Toc510013691"/> examines them with
            respect to the C-CDA implementation guide.</para>

            </footnote> for healthcare applications. The FHIR specification includes a set of
            roughly 90 data models, called “resources,” to represent the various types of clinical
            data objects that may be retrieved via web-services requests. Examples of resources
            include Patient Demographics, Problems, Medication Orders, and Test Results. </para>
        <para>Resources specify the allowed sub-parts of each such clinical data object, which
            sub-parts are required versus optional, and the data types or enumerated value sets that
            may be used to populate the sub-parts. <xref linkend="_Ref510779798"/> shows part of the
            specifications of the FHIR resource for representing patients’ problems (conditions).
            Formal resource definitions are critical to interoperability because they specify how
            the sender of FHIR-encoded information must represent the clinical data it is
            transmitting and how the recipient of FHIR-encoded information can expect the clinical
            data it receives to be represented.</para>
        <para>The “base” FHIR specification includes relatively few constraints on the
            representation of clinical data (for example, note that only one of the data elements
            shown in <xref linkend="_Ref510779798"/> is required, and no required coding system is
            specified for the coded value in the “code” data element, which identifies the reported
            condition). However, the FHIR formalism allows the specification of “profiles” with
            respect to any resource. Profiles further constrain the allowed or required sub-parts of
            a resource, as well as the values that may be used to populate the sub-parts. Depending
            on their design, such enhanced constraints can achieve greater “plug-and-play”
            interoperability among the organizations that agree to them. </para>

        <para>A set of mutually consistent resource profiles that have been specified by a
            particular group of organizations or for a particular purpose comprises a FHIR
            “Implementation Guide”. Organizations that wish to interoperate using an implementation
            guide typically must conform to the entirety of the resource profiles within it.</para>
        <section>
            <title>U.S. Core Implementation Guide</title>
            <para>The FHIR “U.S. Core” implementation guide (US-FHIR) was developed by HL7, in
                collaboration with the U.S. government and the private sector, specifically to
                support the interoperability requirements of the CMS meaningful use program. A total
                of 18 resource profiles are defined within the US-FHIR implementation guide,
                including <emphasis>Condition</emphasis> (i.e., problem),
                    <emphasis>Results</emphasis> (i.e., lab results),
                    <emphasis>Medication</emphasis>, <emphasis>Immunization</emphasis>, and
                    <emphasis>AllergyIntolerance</emphasis>. </para>
            <para>Although the additional constraints specified in these profiles (relative to the
                “base” FHIR resource definitions) greatly improve their effectiveness for
                interoperability, certain contents of the profiles, as well as of the HL7 FHIR
                profiling mechanism itself, raise potential patient-safety issues. These issues are
                described in detail in the following sections.</para>
        </section>
        <section>
            <title>Remaining Structural Under-Specification</title>
            <para>Although the US-FHIR resource profiles add constraints to the base FHIR resources
                definitions, these constraints still allow important clinical data to be represented
                using multiple incompatible structures. In other words, two organizations that are
                fully compliant with the US-FHIR implementation guide could have different
                interpretations about how certain clinical data are to be represented. When the
                recipient of information is expecting a different structure than the sender
                provides, the recipient may not correctly process or store the information received,
                leading to potential patient-safety risks. Such structural under-specification can
                occur with respect to pre-defined data elements or with respect to so-called
                “extension” data elements. Examples of both appear below. </para>
            <section>
                <title>Pre-defined Data Elements</title>
                <para>Using the “Observation” and/or “Diagnostic Report” resource profiles of
                    US-FHIR, a simple blood-pressure reading could be represented in at least three
                    different ways using the pre-defined data elements of the profiles, as shown in
                        <xref linkend="_Ref478668892"/>. Specifically, the systolic and diastolic
                    components of the reading could be represented as either references to
                    additional <emphasis>Observation</emphasis> instances from a parent Observation
                    instance (A) or from a parent <emphasis>Diagnostic Report</emphasis> instance
                    (B). Further, the systolic and diastolic components could alternatively be
                    represented “in-line” within a single <emphasis>Observation</emphasis> instance
                    (C). </para>

                <para>Although the US-FHIR profiles are further constrained with respect to HL7
                    “base” resource definitions, they are still quite generic and designed to
                    accommodate a large variety of clinical statements. As a result, data elements
                    that are specific to only certain types of clinical information and are needed
                    to express the clinically important details of that information are often not
                    part of the US-FHIR profiles. For example, the US-FHIR
                        <emphasis>Observation</emphasis> profile has no pre-defined attributes to
                    represent the body position of a patient (upright vs. recumbent) when a
                    blood-pressure reading was taken, a potentially significant factor in the
                    clinical interpretation of the reading.</para>
                <para>In these cases, representing such details requires the addition of “extension”
                    data elements to individual instances of resources, which the FHIR standard
                        allows<footnote xml:id="__EN3__">

                    and structures, and their values may be represented using arbitrary data types

                    correctly process or even recognize the additional information that has been

            <title>Negation Issues</title>
            <para>In certain clinical situations, it is important to document and communicate that a
                patient does <emphasis>not</emphasis> have a specific condition, medication allergy,
                past surgical procedure, or family history of a disorder. For decision-support and
                reporting purposes, it is important to represent such information in a structured
                and formal manner amenable to automated processing. However, the constructs for
                negation provided by the FHIR standard, in general, and by the US-FHIR
                implementation guide, in particular, are still immature and inconsistent.
                Specifically, there exist multiple, inconsistent ways of negating the same
                information, the precise scope of negation is poorly defined, and certain types of
                information lack a structured negation mechanism. All of these issues create the
                potential for negated information that is communicated in fully-compliant US-FHIR
                resources to be improperly stored or processed by recipients, with possible
                patient-safety implications. The sections below discuss each of these types of
                issues.</para>

                <title>Negation Underspecification</title>
                <para>Where negation is explicitly supported within US-FHIR resources, there often
                    exist multiple inconsistent methods for negating the same data. For example, the
                    US-FHIR <emphasis>Condition</emphasis> profile provides at least three distinct
                    methods to explicitly indicate that a patient does not have a specific
                    condition:</para>

                            type “Situation With Explicit Context”, which itself can denote the

                        <para>The data element “code” may be populated with the specific SNOMED-CT
                            code 160245001, which denotes “No current problems or

                        <emphasis>Condition</emphasis> profile with respect to mutual dependencies
                    among these attributes. For example, if the SNOMED-CT code for “No
                    cardiovascular symptom” is populated as the value of the data element “code,”
                    can the resource instance also contain the value “resolved” in the
                    clinicalStatus data element and/or a value of “refuted” in the
                    verificationStatus data element? What would be the correct meaning of such an
                    instance if all three attributes denoted negation (e.g., a triple negative)? The
                        <emphasis>Condition </emphasis>resource specifications does not address
                    these situations.</para>
                <para>When multiple methods exist to represent the same semantic meaning with
                    limited constraints on their usage, it creates the potential that a receiving

                    combination of the methods when they are used together. In this case, it could
                    result in a negated condition or allergy being interpreted as being

                <para>Where resource profiles include explicit attributes for negating information
                    (such as the verificationStatus and clinicalStatus data elements described
                    above), the FHIR standard does not define which other data element values the
                    negation applies to and, therefore, the precise meaning of the resource
                    instance. For example, the <emphasis>Condition</emphasis> resource profile
                    includes various qualifying data elements for any condition that may be
                    specified, such as “onsetDate”, “severity”, “bodySite”, etc. When such data
                    elements have been populated and the verificationStatus or clinicalStatus
                    elements denote negation, the FHIR resource definition does not specify whether
                    the condition is negated in its entirety, or only in the specific context of the
                    qualifier values. </para>

                    joint pain anywhere and of any severity and any duration at the time the
                    condition was recorded, or only that the patient had no joint pain with the

                    specific interpretation made by a system receiving such a FHIR resource instance
                    could influence decision-support rules or even the display of the data to users,
                    thereby potentially impacting patient care and patient safety if the

                <para>In addition to FHIR resources with underspecified mechanisms for denoting
                    negation and an undefined scope of negation, there exist other FHIR resources

                    resources Procedure and FamilyMemberHistory. In these cases, it is not possible
                    to communicate, for example, that a patient has never had cardiac
                    catheterization, or that neither the patient’s father nor mother have a history
                    of cancer<footnote xml:id="__FN1__">

                </footnote>, which are defined as those data elements of a FHIR resource whose
                values could substantively modify the meaning of the entire resource instance.
                Negating data elements, such as clinicalStatus and verificationStatus, are examples
                of such modifying elements, but others also exist, such as the “notGiven” element of
                the Immunization resource and the “prohibited” element of the Care Plan resource. </para>
            <para>The importance of modifying elements is that they have the ability not only to
                    <emphasis>add</emphasis> detail about the primary clinical information
                communicated by the resource (such as adding the date of a patient’s immunization or
                the severity of a patient’s diagnosis), but they can fundamentally <emphasis>change
                    the meaning</emphasis> of the primary clinical statement. Operationally, this
                means that receiving systems cannot choose to ignore modifying elements when
                processing or storing the data in a FHIR resource instance (such as whether the
                primary clinical statement is, in fact, absent), whereas they could otherwise ignore
                certain details of a resource instance that are not of interest (such as the
                specific person who recorded a clinical observation or the specific reason a
                procedure was performed, which do not change the fact that the observation was made
                or the procedure was performed). The following sections discuss the patient-safety
                implications of modifying elements.</para>
            <section>
                <title>Potential for Misinterpretation by Senders or Recipients</title>
                <para>The patient-safety implications of modifying elements is that they may not be
                    handled or interpreted correctly by receiving systems. As discussed in Sections
                        <xref linkend="_Toc510013682"/> and <xref linkend="_Ref510100957"/>, the
                    semantics of modifying elements that explicitly negate resource instances are
                    not well defined, and the meanings of their values may be interpreted
                    differently by a sending and receiving system or used incorrectly by one or
                    both. For example, the verificationStatus value of “refuted” is formally defined
                    by HL7 as “Has been ruled out by diagnostic and clinical evidence,” but could be
                    easily misconstrued by a sending system to mean “has been characterized by the
                    patient as not present” (although patients are sometimes mistaken or do not
                    remember everything). If such an error is made, a receiving system hewing to the
                    formal HL7 definition would conclude that some clinical condition is
                    definitively absent and proceed with decision-support advice under that
                    assumption, whereas the sending system would not have intended to communicate
                    that level of certainly. Obvious patient-safety issues may result from such a
                    misunderstanding between systems.</para>

                <title>Modifying Extension Elements</title>
                <para>As mentioned in Section <xref linkend="_Toc510013680"/>, the sender of a FHIR
                    resource instance may add an “extension” element to any resource or any element
                    within a resource. Such extension elements serve to add additional information
                    to the resource data structure that has not been defined <emphasis>a
                        priori</emphasis> in the base definition or the profile definition of the
                    resource. Usually, if a receiving system does not recognize an extension element
                    within a resource instance, it can choose to simply ignore it and only process
                    those data elements it recognizes without risk of misinterpreting them. </para>
                <para>In certain cases, however, such extension elements may, themselves, be
                    Modifying Elements (as described in Section <xref linkend="_Toc510013685"/>),
                    such that they can change the fundamental meaning of the entire resource
                    instance). These elements are referred to as “Modifier Extensions”. For example,
                    a sending application could theoretically add a modifier extension element to a
                        <emphasis>MedicationRequest</emphasis> resource instance that indicates the
                    patient should NOT take the medication as prescribed for the next 3 days.</para>
                <para>Modifier extensions must be recognized and correctly processed by receiving
                    systems, i.e., such systems cannot safely interpret the meaning of the
                    transmitted data without appropriately considering and applying the value of any
                    modifier extensions. However, modifier extensions that are not part of the
                    US-FHIR implementation guide could be entirely unexpected and unknown to a
                    receiving system, although a resource instance containing such extensions would
                    be entirely compliant with the US-FHIR implementation guide (such as the example
                    above). In these cases, the HL7 FHIR standard specifies that the receiving
                    system must do one of two things<footnote xml:id="__EN5__">

                    could process the resource (not, for example, a “headless” application that
                    automatically retrieves patient data prior to a patient’s appointment), and even
                    then, the user may not be knowledgeable enough to correctly interpret the

                <para>Hence, the ability provided by the FHIR standard for sending systems to

            <para>An important specific feature of FHIR profiles is that they may designate certain
                data elements within a resource profile as “Must Support,” meaning that every
                implementation that produces or consumes instances of the resource profile mustbe
                aware of and process the data element in some meaningful way<footnote

                </footnote>. However, the FHIR standard does not explicitly define “meaningful
                support” in this context. Rather, the standard only requires that every resource
                profile that includes one or more “Must Support” data elements clearly specify the
                degree of support that is required for any such data<footnote xml:id="__EN7__">

            <para>The Must-Support designation is obviously important for any Modifying Elements

                described in Section <xref linkend="_Toc510013685"/>. The US-FHIR profile,
                therefore, includes Must-Support designations for all such elements. However, the
                profile does not clearly specify the degree or nature of support that is required
                for most such data elements (contrary to the profiling requirements of the base FHIR
                standard), leaving it to the implementers of sending and receiving systems to
                interpret the meaning of “Must Support” for each one. Such latitude may result in
                different, and sometimes incorrect, interpretations across varying implementers,
                with the result that Must-Support elements are not correctly processed by at least
                some recipients of US-FHIR resource instances. To the degree that these elements
                denote clinically relevant information related to negation and other important
                semantics, the absence of clear instructions in the US-FHIR implementation guide
                regarding what support is required for these data elements may pose potential

            <title>Terminology Issues</title>
            <para>The resource profiles of the US-FHIR implementation guide constrain the coding
                systems and value sets that may be used to populate patient data much more than the
                base FHIR resource specifications do. For example, the base FHIR specification for
                the <emphasis>Condition</emphasis> resource specifies no constraints on the codes
                used to identify a reported condition<footnote xml:id="__EN8__">

            <para>However, the terminology constraints specified by the US-FHIR implementation guide
                still leave substantial latitude in the way that certain clinical concepts are
                coded, creating the potential for receiving systems to not recognize or to
                misinterpret important patient data. When complete and accurate data are needed for
                clinical decision support, such gaps can lead to patient-safety problems. The
                terminology issues are of several types, as described below.</para>
            <section>
                <title>Overlapping Coding Systems/Value Sets</title>
                <para>For certain data elements, the code constraint specifies multiple allowed
                    coding systems or value sets, with overlapping content. For example, the
                        <emphasis>AllergyIntolerance</emphasis> resource profile allows drugs to be
                    encoded using either RxNorm, SNOMED-CT, or NDF-RT (with prioritization of NDF-RT
                    for drug classes, and prioritization of RxNorm when an RxNorm code is
                    applicable). However, if a sending system were to incorrectly use SNOMED-CT to
                    transmit a drug class or a specific drug name, a receiving system that expects
                    senders to scrupulously apply the prioritization rules might not recognize the
                    code, resulting in a missed patient drug allergy.</para>
                <para>Such coding latitude granted to the senders of FHIR resource instances
                    requires recipients to recognize and process multiple coding systems, which not
                    all recipients may be prepared to do correctly or at all. Although a
                    prioritization of code-system usage is often specified by the resource profile,
                    depending on the specific data to be transmitted, sending systems may not always
                    be aware of this “fine print” in the specifications and may transmit values from
                    improper coding systems. Most validation engines only recognize when a
                        <emphasis>disallowed</emphasis> code has been used, rather than when an
                    allowed code has been used incorrectly due a sender’s incorrect application of
                    the prioritization rules.</para>
                <para>As another example, the <emphasis>Condition</emphasis> resource profile allows
                    patient problems to be represented using codes from either the SNOMED-CT
                    “Clinical Finding” hierarchy or the SNOMED-CT “Situation-With-Explicit-Context”
                    hierarchy (i.e., both hierarchies are included in the specified value set). For
                    certain clinical concepts, however, these two encoding methods use different
                    SNOMED-CT terminology models to encode essentially the same concepts.
                    Specifically, the Clinical Finding hierarchy encodes the problem as a single
                    finding concept (such as “Dizziness (finding)” [SCTID: 404640003]) whereas the
                    Situation-With-Explicit-Context hierarchy encodes it as a combination of a
                    finding and associated presence/absence attribute (such as “Dizziness present
                    (situation)” [SCTID: 162260006]). In this example, both codes indicate that the
                    patient experienced dizziness, but a receiving system may not expect the more
                    complex “Situation-With-Explicit-Context” code, nor be able to correctly
                    classify it in a disease hierarchy or map it to its local coding system. Again,
                    if a previously documented problem of dizziness is not recognized and
                    appropriately stored by the receiving system, a missed diagnosis or other risk
                    to patient safety could ensue.</para>

                <para>Other data elements within US-FHIR resource profiles may specify a single
                    coding system or value set, but also allow codes outside of that enumerated list
                    to be used when a resource instance is created by a sending system.</para>
                <para>For example, the <emphasis>Observation</emphasis> resource profile specifies
                    that implementers “SHOULD” use only codes from SNOMED-CT for coded results when
                    populating the “value” data element. However, the HL7 FHIR conformance rules
                    define the “SHOULD” constraint as “a best practice or recommendation to be
                    considered by implementers within the context of their particular
                        implementation.”<footnote xml:id="__EN10__">

                    </footnote> This is in distinction to the “SHALL” constraint, which the
                    conformance rules define as “an absolute requirement for all implementations.”
                    The result of a “SHOULD” rather than a “SHALL” constraint, therefore, is that
                    senders of <emphasis>Observation</emphasis> resource instances are free to use
                    any coding system whatsoever for the “value” field and still remain fully
                    conformant to the US-FHIR implementation guide (i.e., the use of a non-standard
                    code should not be flagged as an error by US-FHIR validation engines).</para>
                <para>This optionality in coding could lead to patient-safety issues because the
                    “value” data element in an Observation resource instance can contain clinically
                    important coded data, such as the identity of cultured organisms for patients
                    with serious infectious diseases. To the extent that receiving systems may not
                    recognize the cultured organisms if they are not coded per the suggested (but
                    not required) SNOMED-CT coding system, any decision-support or automated
                    disease-surveillance systems containing logic that depends on coded culture
                    results may fail, with potentially adverse patient-safety implications. </para>
                <para>As another example, the <emphasis>Condition</emphasis> resource profile
                    specifies that implementers must use codes from a designated “Problem” value set
                    when populating the “code” data element, but this terminology constraint is
                    designated as “extensible”. The HL7 FHIR conformance rules define an
                    “extensible” terminology constraint as follows<footnote xml:id="__EN11__">

                <para><emphasis>The code populating this data element SHALL be from the specified
                        value set if any of the codes within the value set can apply to the concept
                        being communicated. If the value set does not cover the concept (based on
                        human review), alternate codes (or text) may be included
                    instead.</emphasis></para>
                <para>The “extensible” designation allows a sending system to transmit an arbitrary
                    code if it determines, at its own discretion, that no code from the Problem
                    value set exactly corresponds to the condition being reported. For example, if
                    the sending system stores a patient problem as a highly specific ICD-10 code for
                    which no exactly matching SNOMED-CT code exists (such as “Nodular lymphocyte
                    predominant Hodgkin lymphoma, lymph nodes of inguinal region and lower limb”
                    [ICD-10 C81.05] ), then the sending system is allowed to send the ICD-10 code or
                    even free text in the “code” element of the <emphasis>Condition</emphasis>
                    resource instance. In such a case, it is again unlikely that an automated
                    validation engine would detect this code substitution as an error even if a very
                    similar SNOMED-CT code existed (for example, representing a slightly more
                    general concept, such as “Hodgkin lymphoma, nodular lymphocyte predominance”
                    [SCTID 70600005]). </para>
                <para>A similar issue exists for the “code” data element in the
                        <emphasis>Observation</emphasis> resource profile. In this case, the coding
                    constraint specifies that LOINC codes must be used if an applicable LOINC code
                    exists, but leaves it to the sending system to make that determination and to
                    use an alternative coding system if needed.</para>

        <para>The Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) is another formalism developed by HL7 to
            standardize clinical data representation for purposes of interoperability. The CDA is
            analogous to FHIR, although the underlying technologies and representation models are
            different. The CDA standardizes the contents and formatting of <emphasis>XML
                documents</emphasis> that may be used to store and/or transmit patient data. The
            current version of the CDA (Release 2.0) was published in 2005<footnote

        <para>In general, the CDA may be used to define the structure of (1) entire

        <para>Like the base FHIR specification, the base CDA specification is also quite abstract
            and under-constrained, allowing conformant systems to generate highly variable
            representations of the same information, which undermines interoperability. To address
            this shortcoming, various initiatives have used the CDA as the basis for deriving XML
            document specifications that further constrain the CDA data model to try to bring
            document standardization closer to “plug-and-play.” Notably, the Health Information
            Technology Standards Panel (HITSP) developed a family of such specifications for various
            document types approximately 10 years ago, including the continuity of care document

                    specifies the required data structure for representing medications and other
                    substances to which a patient is allergic. The identity of the allergenic
                    substance, however, appears within the “participant” data element of this data
                    structure (rather than the “value” or “code” data element), and the actual

                <para>Further, the required typeCode value of “CSM” indicates that the allergenic
                    substance is consumable (although it need not be, as allergens could be
                    non-consumable substances, such as animal dander or pollen); the required
                    typeCode value of “MANU” indicates that the substance is manufactured (again,
                    although it could be naturally occurring); and the classCode value of “MMAT”
                    indicates that it is a manufactured material (also not necessarily the case).
                    The result is a convoluted data structure in which the template constraints may
                    require instances to contain incorrect typeCode values. Such unnecessarily
                    complex structures increase the potential that a patient’s drug allergies will
                    be improperly recorded by a sending system or misinterpreted by a receiving

                    process of observing the problem has been completed. The status of the problem,
                    itself, is denoted by the value of the “effectiveTime” data element,
                    specifically by the value of the “high” sub-element. If no “high” element exists
                    to denote the date at which the problem resolved, then the problem should be
                    deemed active. If a date is recorded within the “high” element, then the problem
                    should be deemed resolved.</para>
                <para>Again, this representational rubric is convoluted and subject to error on the
                    part of both the sending system and the receiving system. For example, a
                    recipient of the data shown in <xref linkend="_Ref510792401"/> could
                    misinterpret the value “completed” within the “statusCode” data element to
                    indicate that the condition (chest pain, in this case) had resolved when it had
                    not (as indicated by the absence of a “high” data element within the
                    “effectiveTime” element). Such an error could have potentially serious
                    patient-safety implications.</para>
                <para>Conversely, the appearance of another “statusCode” data element within the
                        <emphasis>Problem Concern Act</emphasis> template could be misinterpreted by
                    a receiving system to indicate that a problem was active when it no longer was.
                    Specifically, per the <emphasis>Problem Concern Act </emphasis>template
                    specifications, a value of “active” in this data element indicates that the
                    contained problem is of active concern to the clinician, not necessarily that
                    the problem itself is still active (versus being resolved). In certain cases,
                    past incidents of a condition or symptom (such as chest pain) may remain of
                    concern to a clinician even if the condition or symptom is no longer present at
                    the time the problem list is transmitted. In the example of <xref
                        linkend="_Ref510792401"/>, even if the value of the “high” data element
                    within the <emphasis>Problem Observation </emphasis>template were populated
                    rather than omitted (indicating that the chest pain had resolved), a receiving
                    system could misinterpret the “active” value of the “statusCode” data element in
                    the <emphasis>Problem Concern Act </emphasis>template as indicating that the
                    chest pain was still active. Again, such a misunderstanding could result in
                    diagnostic or treatment errors to the patient, owing to the excessive complexity
                    of the <emphasis>Problem Section </emphasis>template and its nested
                    sub-templates.</para>
                <para>Further complicating the situation, the specification of the <emphasis>Problem
                        Observation </emphasis>template states “If the problem is known to be
                    resolved, but the date of resolution is not known, then the “high” element SHALL
                    be present, and the nullFlavor attribute SHALL be set to 'UNK'. Therefore, the
                    existence of a “high” element within a problem does indicate that the problem
                    has been resolved.” Again, a receiving system could misunderstand the subtle
                    distinction between a “high” element being absent (indicating that the problem
                    is still active) and a “high” element being present and containing no actual
                    date, but having its nullFlavor attribute set to “unknown” (indicating that the
                    problem is resolved). </para>

            <para>The manner in which templates specify that a certain data element must be
                populated is by declaring that the element “SHALL contain” a value. For example, the
                template specification for <emphasis>Vital Sign Observation</emphasis> declares the
                following for the value/unit data element: “SHALL contain exactly one [1..1] value
                with data type="PQ".”</para>
            <para>However, the C-CDA implementation guide allows many required data elements to
                contain no value, but instead a “nullFlavor” annotation that indicates why the value
                is not present. Specifically, the C-CDA implementation guide states</para>
            <para><emphasis>Any SHALL, SHOULD or MAY conformance statement may use nullFlavor,
                    unless the nullFlavor is explicitly disallowed (e.g., through another
                    conformance statement which includes a SHALL conformance for a vocabulary
                    binding to the @code attribute, or through an explicit SHALL NOT allow use of
                    nullFlavor conformance).”</emphasis><footnote xml:id="__EN18__">

            <title>Negation Issues</title>
            <para>As with FHIR resource profiles, C-CDA templates also have insufficiently defined
                mechanisms for negating clinical statements. These shortcoming include multiple
                mechanisms for negating the same information (underspecification), undefined scope
                of negation, and absence of mechanisms to negate certain clinical
                observations.</para>
            <section>
                <title>Underspecification</title>
                <para>Certain C-CDA templates provide multiple methods to negate the same
                    information. For example, the <emphasis>Problem Observation</emphasis> template
                    includes the data element “negationInd” (negation indicator), which may
                    optionally be used to negate the condition denoted by the code that appears in
                    the “value” data element. </para>
                <para>However, the value set for codes in the “value” data element also allows
                    members of the SNOMED-CT “Situation-With-Explicit-Context” hierarchy. Concepts
                    in this hierarchy can, themselves, include negation semantics, such as “Heart
                    murmur absent (situation)” [SCTID: 301131000]. <xref linkend="_Ref510798078"/>
                    shows these two alternative methods for negating a condition that are allowed by
                    the C-CDA <emphasis>Problem Observation</emphasis> template. This redundancy of
                    representation methods increases the potential that a receiving system may not
                    recognize them both, with adverse patient-safety results.</para>

                <title>Unclear Scope of Negation </title>
                <para>In certain cases, when the clinical statement within a C-CDA template is
                    negated via the “negationInd” attribute, it may not be clear which specific
                    aspects of the clinical statement are necessarily untrue and which may remain
                    true. For example, the <emphasis>Immunization Activity</emphasis> template
                    instance in <xref linkend="_Ref510798360"/> suggests that no immunization was

                <para>Intuitively, a receiving system might interpret the negated statement in <xref

                    all was given to the patient on the indicated date. However, the formal
                    definition of the “negationInd” attribute, per C-CDA standard specification,
                    suggests something slightly different: The statement means only that no
                    pneumococcal vaccine was given <emphasis>on the stated date</emphasis>

                    of the vaccination). The exact scope of the negation is, therefore, unclear. The
                    lack of clarity is underscored by the following language in the specification of
                    the HL7 v3 reference information model on which the CDA specification and
                    derived templates are based<footnote xml:id="__EN20__">

                        Jones and for patient John Smith, and the reason for this order is the
                        patient’s history of malignant hyperthermia. However, additional detail in
                        descriptive attributes will limit the effective scope of the negation. For

                <title>Absence of Explicit Negation for Certain C-CDA Templates</title>
                <para>At the same time, other C-CDA templates provide no obvious mechanism to negate
                    certain clinical observations, even when such negation may be needed. For
                    example, the <emphasis>Result Observation</emphasis> template lacks an explicit
                    negation mechanism, although one may be needed to report the negative
                    qualitative results of diagnostic procedures (e.g., an imaging exam that reveals
                    “no pleural effusion”). </para>
                <para>Specifically, the <emphasis>Result Observation</emphasis> template, itself,
                    includes no “negationInd” attribute. Sending systems attempting to encode such
                    negative results will need to resort to other, less precisely specified,
                    mechanisms, such as representing the observation as a coded value in the “code”
                    data element (e.g., “Pleural Effusion” [SCTID 60046008]) and the negation of the
                    observation as a Boolean-typed value in the “value” data element (e.g.,
                    “false”). Alternatively, sending systems might resort to using local codes to
                    represent negated results, believing that no standard codes or other
                    standardized methods exist to represent them. This approach would be entirely
                    consistent with the C-CDA implementation guide because the “value” data element
                    in the <emphasis>Result Observation</emphasis> template allows the use of codes
                    from coding systems other than LOINC if LOINC does not include an applicable
                    code. </para>
                <para>In these cases, receiving systems may not recognize the use of a Boolean-type
                    value or a local code used to represent the negated observation and may
                    therefore misinterpret the meaning of the transmitted data. Again, these
                    situations could result in adverse patient-safety outcomes.</para>

            <title>Terminology Issues</title>
            <para>As with the FHIR resource profiles, the terminology constraints specified by the
                C-CDA templates still leave substantial latitude in the way that certain clinical
                concepts are coded, creating the potential for receiving systems to not recognize or
                to not correctly interpret important patient data. </para>
            <section>
                <title>Overlapping Coding Systems/Value Sets</title>
                <para>In certain cases, C-CDA templates allow sending systems to code certain data
                    elements using multiple coding systems or value sets with overlapping content,
                    including local, non-standard coding systems. This under-constraint of coded
                    terminologies may require receiving systems to recognize and correctly process a
                    variety of different terminologies, increasing the chances that an important
                    clinical datum will not be correctly processed.</para>
                <para>For example, the <emphasis>Result Organizer</emphasis> template specifies that
                    the identity of a reported test panel “SHOULD be selected from LOINC OR SNOMED
                    CT, and MAY be selected from CPT-4; Laboratory results SHOULD be from LOINC or
                    other constrained terminology named by the US Department of Health and Human
                    Services Office of National Coordinator or other federal agency.” Although the
                    specification suggests a prioritization of LOINC over other coding systems for
                    lab results, it does not require even that, allowing SNOMED-CT and CPT-4 codes
                    to be substituted instead, at the discretion of the sending system.</para>
                <para>As another example, the <emphasis>Allergy-Intolerance Observation</emphasis>
                    template specifies that the substances to which a patient is allergic must be
                    represented using a code from a specified value set, but this value set includes
                    codes from four overlapping coding systems: NDFRT drug class codes, RxNORM
                    ingredient codes, UNII ingredient codes, and SNOMED CT substance codes. The
                    specification clarifies the process by which a sending system should select the
                    correct code as follows: “The expectation for use is that the chosen concept
                    identifier for a substance should be appropriately specific and drawn from the
                    available code systems in the following priority order: NDFRT, then RXNORM, then
                    UNII, then SNOMED CT.” However, any of the four coding systems are allowed and
                    would be accepted by a C-CDA validation check.</para>
                <para>Finally, in the <emphasis>Family History Observation</emphasis> template, the
                    condition reported for a designated family member must be selected from a value
                    set that includes both SNOMED-CT finding codes (such as “Blood coagulation
                    disorder (disorder)” [SCTID 64779008]) as well as SNOMED-CT
                    situation-with-explicit-context codes (such as “Family history of blood
                    coagulation disorder (situation)” [SCTID 108801000119109]). In the context of a
                    family history, these two codes have the exact same semantics, and either may be
                    selected by the sending system, although certain receiving systems may not be
                    prepared to process a situation-with-explicit-context codes correctly (for
                    example, not being able to identify the actual disorder within the
                    pre-coordinated concept).</para>

                <title>Optional Coding Systems/Value Sets</title>
                <para>Beyond the complexity arising from data-element values that may be coded using
                    different, overlapping coding systems, the C-CDA implementation guide also
                    introduces complexity and uncertainty by under-constraining whether values must
                    be coded using a standard coding system at all. Specifically, within numerous
                    C-CDA templates, the value set specified for an important code has a “SHOULD”
                    designation, instead of a “SHALL” designation, so senders can choose to use
                    other than the designated terminologies and still be compliant with the CCD
                    standard (although such data may be useless to the recipient from a semantic
                    interoperability perspective – e.g., for automated decision support).</para>

                <title>Underspecification of Post-Coordinated Expressions in Problem
                    Observations</title>
                <para>The post-coordination of clinical concepts using a well-defined terminology
                    model and syntax provides the opportunity to formally code a much greater
                    variety of clinical statements than possible using only the pre-coordinated
                    contents of even very large coding systems. Such post-coordination has the
                    benefits of preserving more of the information from the originally recorded
                    patient data in a sending system without having to resort to the transmission of
                    local proprietary codes or free text. </para>
                <para>The C-CDA <emphasis>Problem Observation</emphasis> template ostensibly
                    supports the inclusion of post-coordinated coding expressions in problem list
                    entries via the “qualifier” data element. Specifically, this data element can be
                    used to further detail in a structured fashion the condition coded in the
                    “value” data element of the template. For example, <xref linkend="_Ref510799056"

                <para>Although this mechanism for representing post-coordinated expressions in the
                        <emphasis>Problem Observation</emphasis> template is potentially useful, the
                    C-CDA template specification does not, in fact, specify or constrain how valid
                    post-coordinated expressions can be constructed. In fact, the template
                    description states only the following:</para>
                <para><emphasis>The observation/value and all the qualifiers together (often
                        referred to as a post-coordinated expression) make up one concept.
                        Qualifiers constrain the meaning of the primary code, and cannot negate it
                        or change its meaning. Qualifiers can only be used according to well-defined
                        rules of post-coordination and only if the underlying code system defines
                        the use of such qualifiers or if there is a third code system that specifies
                        how other code systems may be combined.</emphasis></para>
                <para>Although SNOMED-CT (the recommended coding system for representing problems in
                    the <emphasis>Problem Observation</emphasis> template) does specify a
                    terminology model and compositional grammar (syntax) for representing
                    post-coordinated expressions, the C-CDA template specification does not indicate
                    how expressions constructed using this grammar should be specifically
                    represented within template instances (Note that the example in <xref
                        linkend="_Ref510799056"/> provides just one possible representation,
                    developed by the author). </para>
                <para>Because SNOMED-CT post-coordinated concepts can constitute complex,
                    multiply-nested expressions, the absence of a formal syntax within the C-CDA
                    template for representing such expressions leaves latitude for different sending
                    systems to represent the same expressions differently, which complicates or even
                    obviates the ability for receiving systems to recognize and process such
                    expressions correctly. When the expressions contain important information
                    relevant to decision-support processes, the result of this underspecification
                    may be an adverse patient-safety outcome. </para>

        <title>Summary and Next Steps</title>
        <para>This whitepaper presents a number of data-modeling issues within the US-FHIR and C-CDA
            implementation guides that create the potential for patient-safety problems. Although
            certain of these issues may be fundamental to the underlying formalisms of FHIR and CDA,
            others are a result of specific choices made in defining US-FHIR resource profiles and
            C-CDA templates. A forthcoming whitepaper on this topic will suggest ways that these
            profiles and templates could be modified to reduce or eliminate the potential
            patient-safety problems raised by their current designs.</para>
