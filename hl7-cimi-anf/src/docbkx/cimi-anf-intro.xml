        <title>Background</title>

        <para>
            The Clinical Information Modeling Initiative (CIMI) is an HL7 group that is defining a library of detailed clinical information models using a common modeling formalism. CIMI was established to improve the interoperability of healthcare information systems through shared implementable clinical information models that can be used to generate platform-specific model specifications such as FHIR profiles or CDA templates. These models are grouped into semantically equivalent (or ‘isosemantic’) families of clinical models, which capture the same clinical meaning using different combinations of concept pre-coordination and corresponding information model structure.
        </para>

        <para>
        	Here, we introduce a new isosemantic representation that is designed to aid in the analysis of clinical information. This representation is called Analysis Normal Form (ANF).

        <title>Purpose</title>

        <para>
            The purpose of this document is to inform the CIMI community about ANF and why it is needed as an additional standard isosemantic representation of models within CIMI.

        <title>Scope</title>

        <para>
            This document will present the specification of the Analysis Normal Form (ANF), how it is used to create detailed clinical models (DCMs), and how it differs from CIMI's current standard modeling paradigm.
