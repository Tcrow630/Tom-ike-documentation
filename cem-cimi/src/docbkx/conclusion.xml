    <title>Conclusion</title>

  <para>
      Despite the semantic and syntactic differences that exist between CIMI and Intermountain CEMs, there are also many consistencies. Although it is probable we will encounter issues not discussed in this white paper, it is equally probable we will also find a workable solution for those problems.  Using the transformation methodology presented will give us a high probability for success in the transformation from Intermountain CEMs to CIMI models.
