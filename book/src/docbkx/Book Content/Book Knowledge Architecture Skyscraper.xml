    <title>The Knowledge Architecture</title><?oxy_comment_end?>
    <para>In the following sections we will discuss the knowledge architecture, which is based on
        the foundational design principle known as Separation of Concerns. </para>
    <para>SoC allows a complete system to be subdivided into distinct sections or components with
        well-defined functionality and dependencies. If successful, this approach allows individual
        sections to be reused, as well as designed, implemented, and updated independently to
        address emerging requirements. This is especially useful and important in a medical context
        given how many different health information and clinical terminology projects are ongoing at
        any given time.</para>
    <para>This knowledge architecture enables IKM by building on the work of others, rather than
        re-inventing the wheel or a new terminology standard. </para>

        <title>The Knowledge Architecture</title>
        <para>Increased reliance on computerized health records, including EHR Systems, requires
            standardized medical terminology to encode health information consistently across
            systems and enterprises. Clinicians require not only objective quantitative measurements
            (e.g., 90 beats per minute for a patient’s pulse), but also procedural context (e.g.,
            pulse oximetry, manual) about past observations or requests for future interventions.
            While two quantitative measurements may be the same, the procedural information could
            indicate meaningful semantic differences and lead to different clinical interpretation
            and treatment. As information is exchanged across systems, an interoperable solution
            requires a common understanding of data, a method to support knowledge representation,
            and clinical decision rules based on common terminology and statements to ultimately
            address the requirements of medical proffesionals. Current implementations of Health
            Level Seven International (HL7), a variety of global standards for the transfer of
            health data, relies on profiles and templates to disambiguate statement and terminology
            and provide sufficient precision for transactions, documents, and standards-based
            Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Therefore, the architectural approach
            described here is applicable to standards organizations developing interoperability for
            enterprise and project-specific implementations in equal measure.</para>
        <para>The Knowledge Architecture, by definition, is a framework for clinical information
            that is organized into distinct layers such that each higher layer relies upon artifacts
            from the lower layer. The purpose of the Knowledge Architecture is to standardize
            clinical statements and terminologies and eliminate abstract and unnecessary complexity
            by:</para>

            can be reused, developed, and updated independently and serves as an implementation of
            SoC. If employed, this model can help the healthcare ecosystem to individually resolve
            issues in their data within their layers, rather than the entire system, leading to much
            more agile improvement.</para>

        <para>Detailed descriptions of each layer will be spelled out in the chapters that follow,
            but brief descriptions of each can be found below:</para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Versioned Foundation</emphasis> (a) the foundation and building
            blocks of the common model (b)how the repeatable transformation process of disparate
            standards into the common model promotes interoperability with other environments (c)how
            the modules of the architecture are tightly version controlled over time. This layer
            includes common elements of interoperability such as object identity, versioning,
            modularity, exchange paradigms, and knowledge representation.</para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Terminology Knowledge</emphasis> builds upon the foundational
            architecture to create artifacts of medical terms and codes (i.e. SNOMED CT, LOINC®,
            RxNorm) that <emphasis role="italic">define concepts of interest, including
                descriptions, dialects, language, and semantic hierarchy.</emphasis>This layer
            defines what valid codes or expressions may be used by higher levellayers</para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">The Assertional Knowledge Layer </emphasis>makes use of
            versioned foundation and terminology knowledge <emphasis role="italic">to specify
                non-defining facts that may be used by imperative knowledge algorithms</emphasis>
            based on relationships between data elements. Assertional knowledge may be used to
            indicate what symptoms may be associated with a disorder or what treatment is optimal
            for a condition.</para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">The Statement Model Layer </emphasis>is responsible for
                <emphasis role="italic">defining how data elements are combined to create a
                statement</emphasis>. This layer reuses the artifacts defined in the previous layers
            to combine data elements into statements. The statement model layer includes
            standards-based clinical statements like ANF and CIMI and statement models that may be
            implemented using HL7 V2, CDA, FHIR, etc.</para>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">The Imperative Knowledge Layer </emphasis>(also known
                as<emphasis role="bold"> Imperative Knowledge</emphasis>) is <emphasis role="italic"
                >the knowledge exercised in the performance of some task</emphasis>. This is the
            action-oriented layer that uses information from the assertional knowledge layer that
            can enable clinical decision support for clinical alert rules, reminders, etc. that
            trigger actions or recommend interventions to ultimately improve quality measurement and
            patient safety.</para>
        <para>Through concerted efforts across the healthcare ecosystem, we can begin to address the
            primary challenges of improving patient care and enterprise analytics capabilities with
            improved data quality. Establishing a shared, scientific IT foundation through
            Integrated Knowledge Management (IKM) and a robust knowledge architecture leads to
            significant improvements in healthcare. By ensuring high-quality, well-structured data,
            healthcare organizations can enhance the safety and effectiveness of patient care,
            enable more accurate clinical decision support, and facilitate reliable data comparisons
            for public health decision-making. Additionally, this foundation empowers advanced
            analytics, such as AI and machine learning, to drive research, innovation, and better
            resource allocation. Ultimately, these capabilities support safer patient outcomes and
            more effective population health management.</para>
